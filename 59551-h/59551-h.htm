<h2><span class="smaller">TO THE<br />
RIGHT HONOURABLE<br />
THE</span><br />
Countess of ——</h2>

<p class="noindent">MADAM,</p>

<p>Happiness being the
grand Object of human
Pursuit, it may, I imagine,
be modestly presumed, that
every Attempt, however ineffectual,
to render That universal,
must be universally well received.
And yet, conscious as I am that
the following Essay aims solely
at this Point, the Fear of it’s being
too feeble to stand alone,
makes me desirous of procuring
it the additional Strength of your
Ladyship’s Countenance and
Protection.</p>

<p>The Subject is undoubtedly
of great Moment, namely, the
proper Government of Children;
which being ranged under the
Heads of <span class="smcap">Health</span>, <span class="smcap">Manners</span>,
and <span class="smcap">Education</span>, affords not
only the Opportunity of exposing
many Errors, too generally
adopted, but also of pointing out
a more natural and rational
Method of attaining the End
proposed, than is usually pursued.
And I cannot but think,
that, if this Method were seriously
attended to, the Happiness of all
Mankind would be built on a
more solid Basis, than it has in
common hitherto been.</p>

<p>Works of this Kind naturally
calling on the Great and Good
for Patronage; it cannot be
thought strange that I aspire to
the Honour of your Ladyship’s
Protection is the Privilege of the
Powerful: And therefore, where
Power is happily joined with
Goodness, the Recourse of the
Weak to it’s beneficent Influence,
is but a just Tribute of
that Homage which is due to
superior Merit: And such is
the unfeigned Respect I mean
to pay your Ladyship by this
Address.</p>

<p>I have yet another Motive for
presuming to offer this Performance
to your Ladyship; namely,
the Hopes that it’s Use may, by
this Means, be farther extended.
The World, Madam, has it’s
Eyes upon You: The many Excellencies
of Mind and Heart so
conspicuous in Yourself; and the
uncommon Lustre of every eminent
Virtue in the noble Lord,
with whom you have wisely chosen
to share the Dignity and
Duties of the Matrimonial and
Parental State, have justly gained
you, not only general Admiration,
but general Esteem.</p>

<p>When the World shall behold
you declining many of it’s Allurements,
to yield to the stronger
Attraction of Parental Affection;
when it shall see you often
decline the Assemblies of the
Great, and retreat from the Splendor
of a Court, to take upon you
the Office of a tender Mother, by
cherishing, watching over, and
instructing your Offspring; when
the World, I say, shall behold
you employed in Actions like
these, it will not only be charmed
with the pleasing Task you have
undertaken, but be powerfully
animated to pursue the same
Measures; which alone can procure
that solid Happiness all
seek, or seem to seek, yet so few
find.</p>

<p>That nothing may ever interrupt
your present Felicity;
but that it may be augmented
to the most exalted Degree, by
the additional Blessing of wise
and virtuous Children, is the
sincere and fervent Wish of,</p>

<h2>ADVERTISEMENT.</h2>

<p><i>The important Business of the Management
of Children, thro’ every
Stage of our Dominion over them, has
led many Writers to handle the Subject:
but on this, as on other Occasions, each
has had some particular Point in View;
and each has directed his Steps to that
End. One has considered only the State
of Infancy, and, with an Eye to their
Health chiefly, laboured to point out the
Means of preserving it: another has passed
over that State, as if of no Consequence;
and, while nobly aiming at regulating
the Passions, has inadvertently
suffered them to be too deeply rooted from
an Inattention to their first Appearance:
a third has made it his principal Business
to conduct their Education; and has
either omitted altogether the forming their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
Manners, or has supposed, what is very
far from being generally true, that the
one is a necessary Consequence of the other;
or in other Words, that good Education
will always produce good Manners. Others
have confined themselves to one Species of
Education; or, if they aimed at a perfect
Piece, it was for an Individual
only, or at most, for one Class of a whole
Kingdom.</i></p>

<p><i>Yet, of the many excellent Performances
on these Heads, no one, that can
here be recollected, has either been extended
to general Life, or has comprehended the
Whole of a Parent’s Care for their Offspring.
In one we see delineated the
Education of a Prince; in another, of
an able Statesman; in a third, of a great
Commander; and so on: but these are
too narrow to instruct the Whole, and too
confined to become general Rules. They
resemble, if the Comparison may be allowed,
some great Masters in Painting;
one is happy in hitting the Likeness; another
gives an exquisite Softness and Ease
to the Fall of the Arms; a third has a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>
peculiar Grace in his Attitudes; yet all,
perhaps, are obliged to a fourth for the
Delicacy of the Drapery: while he too,
who excels in this, is unable to reach any
Degree of Perfection in the rest.</i></p>

<p><i>But here the Reader is presented with
a more extensive Plan on the Government
of Children; a Plan adapted to general
Use; calculated for familiar Life: and
which, without a Thought of Arrogance,
or once supposing it perfect, aims at the
Good of all. The</i> first <i>Part treats of the
general Means of preserving Health; in
which every one is equally concerned. The</i>
next <i>relates to forming the Mind; that
is, shews the Use of Manners, and points
out the most rational Method of acquiring
them: to the End, not only that good
Habits may be obtained, but that Reason
may always have the Ascendant of the
Passions. The</i> last <i>Part treats of Education;
which, tho’ here it makes a distinct
Head from Manners, yet are they
to be considered as very strictly connected;
because the more exalted the one is, the
mere conspicuous should the other be. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
in every State or Kingdom there are many
Degrees of Rank and Fortune; so great
Pains have been taken to consider the
Propriety of Education; and to point out
a judicious Degree of it for each Individual.</i></p>

<p><i>Thus it is to be observed, that the
Piece here presented is not designed to direct
the Fathers, and exclude the Mothers;
to govern the Boys, and neglect
the Girls; nor to address the Great, and
disregard the Little; by no Means: it
aspires at offering Advice to all; and,
with equal Zeal, aims at giving Aid to
Parents of every Rank, Sex and Degree.
It regards the Care of Children as long as
the Dominion of Parents may be said to
last; and neither neglects the Infant of a
Day, nor gives up unconcernedly, a Youth
of either Sex, at twenty Years old.</i></p>

<p><i>The Point most laboured at is indeed
that of Manners; not only because they
are of the utmost Consequence in themselves,
and furnish the surest Means of
being happy, and excelling in Life, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
because the present too general Depravity
of them stands publicly confessed.</i></p>

<p><i>Should it be urged, that as a great
deal has already been wrote on the same
Topics, and in a masterly Manner too,
all farther Attempts of the like Nature
seem needless; it may be answered, (besides
what has already been observed) that
so fertile a Subject cannot easily be exhausted;
and being Points of the most
weighty Concern, they will undoubtedly
always furnish thinking Men with Matter
to expatiate on.</i></p>

<p><i>The Thoughts here given are the Result
of Reason, Observation and Experience;
and should it be said that they are
not new, still it is hoped they have a
Claim to some Degree of Regard, as
there is always both Use and Entertainment
in displaying even the same Sentiments
in a different Manner.</i></p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p>Nothing is more evident, than
that a Love of our Children is a great
ruling Principle in human Nature;
and that it makes a large Part of that Self-love
which sticks so closely to us. For them
we aim at Wealth, Power, and Dignity;
for them our Views are endless, our Desires
boundless. Nor do we stop here; for, eager
as we are in pursuing the real or seeming
Good of our Children, we extend our Views
still farther, even to their Children. And
it is certain, that Mankind in general do not
think the great Business of Life compleat,
unless they live (as it is usually termed) to
see their Children settled, and in a Way of
contributing to the great Family of the
World. But were none to engage in a State
of Wedlock in order to become Parents,
till their Abilities to train up their little Offspring
were try’d and approv’d, I am of
Opinion the Number of Marriage Licences
would be greatly abridg’d.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>Many run precipitately into this important
State, without any Fore-thought at all; but
even among the wary, the discreet, and the
wise, how very few are there who reflect on
the Duty of first acquiring such a Degree of
Knowledge as may serve to make their Children
happy in them, and themselves happy
in their Children? It is this general Defect
in human Life, which has induced me to offer
my own Thoughts on the Government of
Children; and my Aim herein is, to point
out the Errors committed in this important
Work, and propose some Means of preventing
them for the future. A learned Writer
on the Art of Medicine<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> says, that he
who advances the Knowledge of it, tho’ but
a Step, deserves the Thanks of the whole
Species; if then I am but happy enough to
give one useful Hint, one helping Hand for
the Public Good, I shall esteem my Labours
abundantly rewarded. But before I
go any farther, let me be understood: I am
not giving Laws, but Counsel. The Experience
I have gained in the tutoring seven
Children of my own, joined to the Observations
I have made on the Management of others
of every Age and Degree, seem to give me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
some Title to hope my Thoughts may
prove useful; if so, my End is answered.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Pope</i>, in his moral Essays, tells us,
that all Happiness lies in three Words;
Health, Peace, and Competence. May we
not then hope, that an Endeavour to point
out the Way to Health, Manners, and
Education, will help us in the Pursuit of
this great Object? For these rightly understood
and well conducted, Peace and Competence
will seldom fail to follow.</p>

<p>Manners however is the grand Point I
aim at; every thing else is secondary to
that. Health, it may not be in our Power
to secure; and School Education, all cannot
reach to in any considerable Degree.
The Government of our Children is indeed
an universal Obligation; but all Men are not
therefore obliged to be Physicians or Pedagogues.
Still, as neither Health nor liberal
Instruction, where proper, are to be neglected,
I shall in their due Place speak of
both, so far as seems necessary for every
Parent to know.</p>

<p>By Manners I do not mean that external
Shew of good Breeding, which consists only
in a Bow, or Curtsy, or other personal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Carriage, tho’ this too is of Importance;
but I mean, such a uniform Deportment,
such a ready engaging Behaviour, and such
a Propensity to do what is right, as testify a
happy Disposition of the Mind and Heart;
and appear, what they really are, the Fruits
of good Habits, either natural, or acquired,
or both.</p>

<p>The grand Source of the too general Defect,
we cannot but observe and lament in
the Manners of Children, is partly in themselves,
but chiefly in their Parents. In
themselves it arises from a natural Love of
Ease and Liberty; in Parents, from a supine
Neglect of that necessary Knowledge
already hinted at: in short, from want of
reflecting why they are Parents, and what is
incumbent on them to do, in order to make
their Children happy in themselves, and useful
to Society. But how shall I be sheltered
from the Imputation of Vanity? I am well
aware how liable a Man is to be censured, for
attempting to point out to others, what
every one supposes himself to be already acquainted
with: and where are the Parents
who once suspect, that they are so little acquainted
with the Duties of their State, as to
be themselves the Causes of their Children’s
Misconduct?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>That there are many whose Ability in this
important Work is far superior to any thing
I can pretend to, I am convinc’d; many who
are happily endowed with a competent Penetration
and Skill to manage the Temper,
Genius, and Passions of Children, and who
are equally assiduous in the Exercise of those
Gifts for the Benefit of the rising Generation:
neither is it for these I write; rather do I
wish to receive their Instructions myself.
But, that the Bulk of Mankind are wholly
thoughtless of, or unacquainted with, the
proper Methods of managing Children, is, I
think, very evident. In proof of which I
appeal to every one’s own Observation. Let
the Generality of People look round them,
and reflect how they find the Majority of
Children of every Rank among their Acquaintance.
Are they innocent, tractable,
orderly, and courteous? Are they tolerably
instructed in the Knowledge necessary for
their Age and Station? Or are they not rather
corrupt and untoward? Are they not
rather unruly to a Degree of Pity? Incorrigibly
rude, or tolerably civil only by Starts;
grossly ignorant in many Things they ought
to have been taught, and but too knowing
in others it were perhaps better they never
knew at all? If they really find this to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
true in the Children of others, let them turn
their Eyes homewards, and impartially canvas
their own Children’s Deportment; and
if upon discovering any of the like Deformities,
they can resolve to be just to themselves,
I am confident they will to their
great Surprize awaken to the Consciousness
of one Truth, which perhaps they hitherto
never so much as suspected; namely, that
what they have the most Reason to be displeased
with in the Conduct their Offspring,
is chiefly owing to their own want of
Skill, or want of Thought, in the Management
of those tender Plants.</p>

<p>As Men are sometimes seen to forget the
Husband and act the Sovereign only, so are
they apt to think themselves supreme and
independent in the Power they have over
their Children. But can we, upon Reflection,
take it to be the Intention of Nature,
that Children be govern’d by Fathers alone,
while they are in Possession of the Blessing
of having Mothers to share a Part in that
Government? Or can we consider paternal
Sway as an arbitrary Power, absolutely presiding over,
and giving Laws to Children
without any Controul? No. Lest Fathers
thus impower’d should invert the Intention
of the Creation by becoming Tyrants, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
providential Laws of Nature have wisely assigned
a joint Portion of Power to the Mothers;
that the Father’s Authority and the
Mother’s Sweetness being seasonably and discreetly
blended, both might equally contribute
to one and the same great End, the future
Welfare of their Offspring: where the
Roughness of the one serving as a Spur to
egg them on to the Pursuit of Happiness
from a Principle of Awe, the Smoothness of
the other may sooth them forward, from
Motives of Affection; or, in a Word, that
the Sternness of the Father may serve as a
Quickener to maternal Endearments, and the
Mildness of the Mother sweeten and render
palatable the more bitter Draughts of paternal
Harshness.</p>

<p>It is no small Difficulty to fix the Time
in which Parents should take the Reins of
Government into their Hands; but if it be
considered that we are by the Perverseness of
our Nature prone to err, I think they cannot
begin too soon; in short, they should
begin as soon as they become Parents, that is,
as soon as their Children have a Being. This
will appear to be strange Doctrine to those
who have not reflected how very early Children
shew themselves. The Source of
many of our Errors with Regard to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Government of Children, seems owing to a
mistaken Notion of their Incapacity; whereas
in Reality they have some Reason much
earlier than is commonly imagined; but till
that dawns out, the Passions alone are their
Guides. Now if the Passions are suffered to
gather Strength, by cherishing and indulging
them, (which is too commonly the Case)
and Reason remains feeble for want of being
exercis’d, the natural Consequence must be,
that Children will grow obstinate, perverse,
and ungovernable in their Passions, before
Reason is called forth to their Assistance;
and it will often prove a very unsuccessful
Talk to hinder them when grown up, from
being Slaves to themselves, and Plagues to
all about them.</p>

<p>Parents then, to obviate these Evils, have
two principal Points to aim at, for their
own and Children’s Happiness; and indeed
for the Happiness of all Posterity; <i>viz.</i>
weakening their Passions, and strengthening
their Reason. And that this is greatly in
their Power to effect, is an undoubted Truth,
tho’ it may often prove an arduous Task to
reduce to practice. Still it may, and ought
to be aim’d at; and, if I may be allowed to
speak my Sentiments, I think I may confidently
assert, that all social Virtues, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
genuine Happiness which they are productive of,
will insensibly flow from a constant
due Exercise of that Dominion over our
Children, which all Laws divine and human
have entrusted to us.</p>

<p>’Tis wonderful to observe how very early
a Wilfulness is discernable in Children; and
with what swift Progress it gathers Strength,
if not immediately and carefully check’d. I
have seen a Child not above six Months old,
obstinately contending for a certain Position
to be suckled in, and the tender (simply tender)
Mother painfully distorting her Limbs,
and straining her whole Frame, in Compliance
to it, or it would not suck at all: and
I have seen too a Child, before one Year of
Life was compleated, so fantastically, and
yet so obstinately humoursome, that all that
could be devis’d to give it, was not sufficient
to gratify it: it would roar for the first
Thing it saw, then throw it away and fight
for another, and so on without Measure;
and this at the Expence not merely of Baubles,
but of Glasses, China, and other valuable
Things; and often at the still greater
Expence of the Mother’s Peace and Rest.</p>

<p>The next Advance is to the Use of
Speech; and this Faculty is no sooner acquired,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
but immediately follows the Abuse
of it. Many Children, indeed, are slow
and backward in the Acquisition of it, but
few are those who are not too forward in
misapplying this noble Gift. Let a Child
of three Years old, who has been much indulged,
be bid to do any thing, and how
ready is it to answer, <i>I won’t!</i> And if forbid
a thing, how pert to say, <i>I will!</i> Yet
let the fondling Parent ask it ever so plain
and easy a Question, it is a thousand to one,
if a Word of Answer be obtained: the cunning,
obstinate Urchin is instantly dumb,
and nothing shall restore it to the Use of its
Tongue, but the Gratification of its Humour
with a Cake or a Play-thing.</p>

<p>Thus are they generally suffered to run on
to near the Age of Seven, with little or no
Variation, except that of their Appetites
gaining head of their Reason, and multiplying
in proportion to the Objects which excite them.
And as during that Term of
Life which we distinguish by the Name of
Childhood, Parents look upon the infant
Reason of their Children, as incapable of
producing Fruits, they are but too apt to
leave that uncultivated, and to overlook,
with an injudicious Contempt, their early
Deviations from it. But surely it were injuring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
human Understanding, to agree with
such Parents, in an Opinion which condemns
itself; and which they themselves
are universally the first to contradict. For
let the Topic of Children be but broach’d to
any of them, and what Encomiums are we
not sure to be tir’d with upon their own!
What Enlargements on their Comprehension,
their Judgment, their Wit, and the
surprizing Products of all these, in the many
excellent things they say and do! In the
mean time not a single Step is taken to improve
all these boasted Talents, nor to check
the growing Humours which threaten them
with Destruction; and may, if neglected,
grow into Habits more difficult to eradicate
than an hereditary Disease.</p>

<p>Left this should affect but little those Parents,
who are more solicitous that their
Children should be fair in Face, and strong
in Body, than beauteous in Mind, and pure
of Heart, let me convince even these, that
it is dangerous too to the bodily Welfare of
Children, to neglect cultivating their Reason
from their earliest Infancy; or to be
careless of eradicating their little Humours,
as soon as discover’d. And to this end they
need only view the Majority of them on a
sick Bed; where they will see this melancholy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Truth (for such indeed we may call
it) in its full Light.</p>

<p>Diseases are one Part of the Portion of
human Nature, in a State of Mortality: no
Stage of our Existence is exempt from them,
and Childhood as little as any. Let then
an unmanag’d, humour’d, pamper’d Child
be sick; and besides the Abundance of
otherwise unnecessary Trouble and Affliction
it brings on the Parents and the whole
Family, what Danger is not the Child itself
exposed to, beyond what the Disease brings
with it!</p>

<p>All wise Men agree, that Providence has
furnished the World with Remedies for most
human Diseases, at least in their first Stages,
and Men with Knowledge to apply them.
When skilful People are consulted in Time,
the Medicines good, duly prepared and
given, the Nurse attentive, and the Patient
tractable, there is but little to be apprehended
from the first Stage of any Disease
which is not mortal of itself, where the Habit
of Body is otherwise sound; barring
such Accidents as cannot be foreseen, nor
consequently obviated. But what can Physicians,
Medicines, Nurses, all avail, in the
Disease (otherwise ever so curable) of an untoward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Creature, against whom perhaps
there are great Odds that it shall not be conquered
to swallow the least Portion of the
most absolutely necessary Remedy; nor to
submit in Sickness to the least Controul;
indulged, perhaps, as it has been, in a Habit
of slighting and baffling all Authority
while in Health? Just nothing. No; the
Trouble indeed of attending it, is doubled
and trebled to those who are constantly
about it; the Expence is at least the same,
if not considerably augmented; and the
Confusion, Affliction, and Alarms of the
Parents, at the growing Danger of their
spoil’d Darling, immoderately encreas’d, on
finding all Remedies rendered ineffectual to
it, by an Obstinacy which they (whether
conscious of it or not) have heretofore been
the foolish Encouragers of. In the mean
time, the Disease gathers Strength, and the
Child’s Wilfulness with it; and the little ungovernable
Patient falls an untimely Victim
to the former Mismanagement of the mistakenly
fond Parents, and its own present
Unruliness. To see a fond Father, in Spite
of the Impotence of Tears, so general to his
Sex, weeping over his Child, his Heir, his
only Hope of Joy, and vainly entreating
him, whom he might command, to take an
easy Remedy! To behold a tender Mother,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
herself half spent with Grief and Fears, prostrate
at her sick Favourite’s Pillow, expostulating
with all the Eloquence of maternal
Anxiety, and entreating, praying, coaxing
it to swallow a necessary Medicine, but still
in vain! To view the Parents at such a
Juncture, inwardly divided, torn, and almost
consumed, between the alternate Motions
of Tenderness, Impatience, Love, and
Anger, fruitlessly insist, where a Habit of
Subjection should have already made a Word
or a Look sufficient; and yet to find the
humour’d Thing as resolutely bent on refusing,
merely, perhaps, because so much
entreated! To eye all this, I say, were
surely sufficient to convince us, that it is a
strange Inversion of the natural Order of
Things; and has a something in it extremely
absurd: and the more so, when we reflect,
that the whole is an Effect of Folly in the
Parents, and chiefly owing to their former
Neglect of exerting a little prudential Authority.</p>

<p>If this be too frequent a Case, as the Experience
of many People must convince
them it is, let Parents in general remember,
that their watchful Industry to conquer and
regulate the little growing Passions and Humours
of their tender Offspring, is as necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
towards the Preservation of their Bodies,
as for the Culture of their Minds.</p>

<p>That this Difficulty of conquering Children,
and rendering them tractable while
sick, is no Exaggeration, I might appeal to
the Consciousness of most Parents throughout
the Kingdom; nay, I could support the
Charge by many Instances within my own
Knowledge; but shall content myself with
producing a very few from the Relation of
others. A Friend of mine, who had the
Care of a young Gentleman, lately received
a Letter from his Boarding School, with
this Information; “Master has been much
out of order, and what is worse, was out
of the Reach of the Means of being easily
made better. He had indeed three Doses
of Physic prescrib’d him, but could not
be prevailed on to swallow one; in short,
they were all spilt on the Sheets, for not
a Drop went down his Throat.” A little
Miss not yet able to speak plain (as I was
informed by a Person present) had a Medicine
to take which she obstinately refus’d;
Mamma interferes, and after many fruitless
Entreaties gently corrects her; Miss still
persists in the Refusal, and is chastised with
additional Severity, even to the sixth time;
at length, half breathless with crying, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
ready in appearance to burst with Passion,
she has still her Spirit so little conquered as
to say in her imperfect Gibberish, “Well,
if you <i>till</i> me, I won’t take it.” So
Mamma overcome, lays down the Rod;
and obstinate Miss coming off with the Victory,
shewed she had more Courage to receive
Correction, than the Mother Resolution
to bestow it. The Truth was, that
Mamma had never had a Dispute with the
Child, in which she had not the Weakness to
suffer it to get the better of her. A Lady
of Rank I have the Honour to be acquainted
with, and who I’m sure in other Respects
has good Understanding, forfeited it greatly
on a like Occasion. She told me her
Daughter, when in the Country, having a
Fever, all usual Means were try’d to prevail
on her to take the necessary Remedies, but
in vain! So far from being mov’d to Compliance,
she was thrown into such vehement
Fits of crying, whenever they were offered
to her, that it was apprehended her Fever
would encrease, and endanger her Life: ’till
at length by good Fortune the Lady reflecting
she had a Kitten which Miss was extravagantly
fond of, she resolved to try an
Experiment. Accordingly, as often as any
thing was to be taken by Miss, Mamma
holding Puss in her Hands, protested it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
should be thrown out of the Window and
killed, if she did not take what was given
her; and by this Stratagem brought the
Child to a Compliance, which nothing else
could effect. I own the Expedient was ingenious,
and the Lady gave a Proof of her great
Presence of Mind in turning to the Child’s
Advantage an innocent Foible she had been
indulg’d in. But surely at the same time she
betrayed how much she had before forfeited
her Understanding as well as the true Tenderness
of the Parent, by the little Care she
had taken to inculcate and enforce such
Principles of Obedience and Gratitude, as
should have taught her on the like Occasions
to do at least as much out of Love and Duty
to a fond Parent, as she did out of childish
Attachment to a Kitten. Now however
lightly People may think of these Things,
who are not immediately concerned, they
must and will be acknowledged great Afflictions
to all Parents who love their Children,
and see them in such Circumstances.</p>

<p>’Tis certain that Children may have Disorders
which are not of a dangerous Nature,
and may therefore be got through without a
nice Observance of Rule; but then it is
equally certain, that they have oftentimes
very dangerous ones, which necessarily require<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
both Medicines and Rule. And very
eminent Physicians have declared it as their
Opinion, that many of these tender Lives
have been lost, purely for want of Submission
to the Medicines and Rules prescribed
them. Who then can look back on the
Causes of a Loss so detrimental to Society,
and not be offended at the general Neglect
of Parents to remove them?</p>

<p>Nor can one, reasonably speaking, be less
offended and concerned at the universal Custom
among Parents of remedying on such
Occasions their former Neglects, by present
Falsehoods: that is, I mean, by attempting
to impose on their Children’s Senses and
Understandings by manifest Untruths.
When a Child is to take a Medicine, is it
not ridiculous to call a bitter Draught sour,
or a sour one sweet? Is it less absurd to insist
on a nauseous thing’s being pleasant,
than it is to shew them what is black, and
endeavour to persuade them it is white?
And yet this is the Method commonly made
use of with Children, to beguile down their
Medicines. It is true it may furnish People
with an easy Pretext to expatiate on their
Children’s Capacity; but I am sure it adds
no Honour to their own. They may tell
their Apothecary how much Pains they took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
to cheat the Child, but the little Rogue was
so cunning it would not be cheated! They
may display his Genius by telling how they
called it Wine, and gave it in the dark; or
said it was Tea, and put it into his own
Cup; still nothing could deceive him: Oh!
it is a sensible little Creature! But what all
this while is become of the Sense of the Parents?
For after all this Address, this
mighty Juggle, it must still perhaps be
owned, that the Child does not take the
Dose: or if it should, with a Superiority of
Sense, it justly reproaches the Parents with
having told it a Falsehood. “You said it
was good, but I find it is nasty Stuff,
and I’ll take no more of it.” And too
generally do they keep their Word. Can
Parents so palpably mislead their Children,
and not be sensible of their Mistake? Or
can they be sensible of it, and not blush at
their own Folly?</p>

<p>Thus far we have considered the Untowardness
of Children, with some of its Consequences,
in that Stage of Life we usually
call their Childhood; that is, to seven
Years old; for according to the Custom of
familiar Life, every Septenary is reckoned
a Stage; tho’ Physical Writers divide Life
otherwise. With them there are eight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Stages. From the Birth to three Years old,
is one; viz. the Infancy; from three to ten
another; and so on to Decrepidity. But as
this Treatise attempts to reach no farther
than the Dominion of Parents generally extends,
that is, till they become Men and
Women; it will not be consistent with my
Design, to carry on either Observation or
Precept beyond the third Stage of Life.</p>

<p>Let us therefore proceed to take some
Observation of them in the second Septenary;
when on all Hands it is agreed their
Understandings are open, and capable of receiving
more important Impressions.</p>

<p>Now if we view the Generality of Children
from seven to fourteen, I am afraid we
shall be obliged to confess, that however far
they advance in what is commonly called
Learning, they gain but very little in the
Science of Manners. In <i>William</i> of <i>Wickham</i>’s
famous School at <i>Winchester</i> there is this
Motto, <span class="smcap">Manners maketh Man</span>: Whereby
we are reminded, that all Learning which
does not improve our Manners, is vain and
unprofitable; the Perfection of Manners being
the End, which Learning is only design’d
as a Means to conduct us to. Yet so
it happens, that Parents are frequently misled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
by confounding Names, by taking
one thing for another, and concluding their
Children have Manners because they have
Learning. Whereas in reality, a Child may,
from want of proper Care, have a great deal
of Learning, and no Manners at all: or,
on the other hand, by timely and proper
Tuition, advance greatly in the Improvement
of genuine Manners, with little or no
School Learning: which is all that is generally
understood by the Word Learning,
with regard to Children in the second Septenary.</p>

<p>When a Man becomes Father of a Family,
he usually applies the Boys, as soon
as he deems them of an Age for it, to School
Learning; different according to the Rank
he bears in Life: while the Girls, by a
shameful Indolence or Contempt, are often
neglected in this Particular, and suffered to
become alternate Plagues and Play-things at
home: at least with strictest Truth we may
say, too little Care is taken to form either
the Mind or Heart of these to any great Advantage.
The Boys, if dull, return Blockheads,
and so remain; if smart, grow boisterous,
audacious, conceited, and ungovernable;
tyrannical to their Sisters; disobedient
to their Mother; and scarce are awed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
their Father’s severer Brow. The Girls remain
uncultivated in almost every thing but
Vanity and a Love of fine Cloaths. Indeed
they can work a little, (and perhaps but
little) or they can dance, and so they ought;
but shall scarcely be able to spell a Word
right beyond a Monosyllable; or write the
Direction on a Letter with any Propriety.
Is it an Exaggeration to say this is the usual
Education till fourteen? Surely Experience
convinces us it is not; and tho’ some Exceptions
may doubtless be found, yet they are
few in Comparison with the whole.</p>

<p>Now let me ask the Parents of such Children,
what real Comfort do they find in
them? Do they not often with Sorrow, nay
almost with bleeding Hearts, see them running
counter to their Expectations and
Wishes? Do they not daily see, and must
they not therefore daily lament (unless they
are self-blind) that all their other Profusion
of Kindness so lavishly poured on their Children,
yields neither Profit to them, nor Comfort
to themselves? And whence the Cause
of all this Disappointment? Alas! ’tis too
visible, too apparent! It arises from a Neglect,
or at least an Abuse of that early Authority
they ought to exercise over them:
from a Neglect, in not correcting in time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
their Irregularities and Humours; from an
Abuse, in correcting them without Judgment
and Discretion. Nor does this happen
to People in inferior Stations only; no,
’tis every Day to be met with, not merely
from the Peasant to the Tradesman, but
from the Tradesman to the Nobleman; and
even among those of the finest Understanding.
But whence the Cause of this strange
Misconduct and Omission? It springs, as I
take it, from Ignorance, or Inconsiderateness,
or Partiality, or Passion, or from all
together; but the most frequently of any,
from false Tenderness, and blind Indulgence.</p>

<p>Every Man has his own way of judging,
and generally abides by it right or wrong.
I knew a Gentleman of refined Understanding,
who frequently forfeited it, by a boundless
injudicious Fondness for his Children.
He would say to his little Boy at Table,
Well, my Dear, what shall I help you to?
The Child, accustomed to have his own
Will, unskilled to make a proper Choice,
and following the Gratification of his depraved
Palate, was sure to choose the most
unfit Dish, by choosing the richest, because
the most savory. The Father indeed would
fain set him right, by recommending some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
simpler Food; No, my Dear, he’d say,
have some Mutton, Mutton is best for you;
and so of any other plain wholsome Dish;
but this Advice proves too late, after having
set him wrong; nor would he eat a
Morsel of any thing but what he himself
approved of. The same Gentleman, as a
Proof of his Sense, took abundance of Pains
to inculcate strict Notions of Honour to his
Children, tho’ he often degraded that Sense
in the Application of them. One Day, at
the beginning of the Week, he says to his
Son, My Dear, I know you are a Man of
Honour, and what you once promise you’ll
punctually perform; you are one Day this
Week to take Physic; tell me then, what
Day will you fix on? The Boy pauses a
little, and replies, Saturday, Sir. Oh! fye
my Dear, says the Father, why stay ’till Saturday?
why not take it to-morrow, or next
Day? No Sir, replies the Boy, with an
unbecoming Pertness, I’m upon Honour;
the Choice of the Day was left to me, and
I’ll not take it before. What an amazing
Inversion of Ideas! Honour with Disobedience!
Who in this Case could be said to
hold the Reins of Government, the Parent
or the Child?</p>

<p>Thus too does many an affectionate and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
even sensible Mother both see and feel in a
Daughter, whom Nature perhaps has endowed
with all that might make her sweet
and amiable, an Untractableness she knows
not how to account for. But tho’ it is her
own Mismanagement, or rather no Management
at all, which makes the Girl’s Desires
irregular and inordinate, still the fond Parent
remains blind to the Cause. If Miss knows
Mamma is to go out without her, she’ll eat
no Dinner; if the Dress of the Day is not to
her Fancy, she is sure to remain sullen ’till
Night; and if an accidental Difference is
made to a Sister, or any other of her own
Age, she shall redden, and swell, and pout,
and fret, ’till she has fretted her Mamma
sick, to see her untoward Behaviour; and
possibly fretted herself sick too. ’Tis easy
to discern the Principles she acts upon; they
are Self-will, Vanity, and the Love of Pleasure,
which she has been used to be indulged
in. No wonder then, that when these are
not gratified she is miserable; and while they
are, is it likely that she can long be happy?</p>

<p>There ought to be made a considerable
Difference between the Children of inferior
People, and those of Rank, with regard to
their Tuition; nothing is more reasonable;
since the latter have innumerable Advantages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
over, and are to move in a very different
Sphere from the former. Still the Mistakes
in all are too often essentially the same; and
only conceal’d or varnish’d over by the external
Education. Now, what I contend
for is, that Parents of all Ranks have the
Power, and are equally bound in Duty, to
be themselves the Teachers of their Children,
with regard to that Self-Knowledge,
and the genuine Docility arising from it,
which are necessary to conduct them thro’
Life with Ease and Benefit to themselves, with
Honour and Pleasure to their Parents, and
with universal Advantage to Society in general.
I say again, that all Parents have
the Power of answering this Obligation in
great measure; but those of Rank, Fortune,
and Education, have it in an eminent Degree;
and are therefore utterly inexcusable,
when they give into that gross Neglect of
it; which we daily see, even in the second
and more improveable Stage of human
Life.</p>

<p>Tho’ it is allow’d by all, that Children,
long before they attain the Age of fourteen,
are in general capable of receiving very advantageous
Impressions, and are full as susceptible
of the reverse; yet ’tis pretty evident,
that much the Majority to that Period,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
gain few or no good ones; and I wish
it were not as evident, that their principal
Stock are of the bad Kind. But let us proceed
to consider them in the third Septenary,
which brings them to the Age of
twenty-one; the Period which generally
closes our Obligations to them; shuts out
in great measure our Power over them; and
sets them loose on the great Stage of the
World, every one to act their Part just as
we have taught them. If well, great is our
Honour, great must be our Comfort; and
great and lasting is their Happiness likely
to prove, to themselves, and to Posterity.
If ill, no matter what their Station is, they
disgrace it; and the Disgrace with double
Force is reflected back on ourselves.</p>

<p>’Tis a well-known Maxim, that the first
Impressions strike the deepest. Thus, a
Boy, who before fourteen has never been
convinced that it was necessary for him to
obey, will afterwards laugh at it as ridiculous;
and if his first Lessons were Pride and
Pleasure, the only Use he will make of his
Understanding when more at large, will be
to study to continue in the Pursuit and Augmentation
of those his favourite Objects.</p>

<p>Whether we consider the Heir of a Family<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
at the University, or his younger Brother
in a Merchant’s Compting-house;
whether we consider a young Stripling
destin’d to the Law, to Physic, or view him
behind a Counter; we cannot make a true
Use of our Eyes, without seeing innumerable
Disorders during this third Stage of Life.
For tho’ heretofore he has been treated as a
Child or School-boy, he will now pretend
to judge for himself; and as his Reason is
weak, and his Passions strong, that will
slavishly run in pursuit of every thing which
will promote the Gratification of these. I
have already observed, that the only Use he
will make of his Understanding, will be to
abuse it. For Example, he wants fine
Cloaths, such, perhaps, as are very unbecoming
his Station; he wants two or three
Suits, where one ought to serve; he wants
an encrease of Pocket-money, far beyond a
reasonable Allowance, and often beyond
what his Father can afford; or finally, he
has some more vicious End in view. Now
without once employing his Reason, or reflecting
how much he has abused the Indulgence
of his Parents, his Passions urge him
on to effect whatever they suggest. To gain
his Point then, with Address and Cunning
he applies to his Mother; whose blind Fondness
for her Boy, will not let the Father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
rest, till his prodigal Humour is gratify’d.
The Father, as a good one, shall argue the
Case. “What, my Dear, can I do with
this extravagant Boy? I have spar’d no
Pains nor Expence in his Education, because
on that I grounded all my Hopes
of his future good Conduct and Prosperity;
he don’t want Sense, and has improv’d
pretty well in his Learning: if
not quite so well as perhaps he might
have done with a little more Application,
yet allowing for the natural Thoughtlessness
of his Age, at least well enough to
know how to act better. Still I see little
Prospect of Comfort from him; because
I see no Dispositions in him but to Idleness,
Folly and Extravagance. In short,
if he goes on thus, what better can I expect
than to see him daily plunge deeper and
deeper into Extravagance and Vice:
and what must the Consequence be but
irrecoverable Destruction? Shall I then
by continuing to humour him hurry on
his Ruin, perhaps in my own and yours?”
But the fond Mother still persuading him
that every present Folly is to be the last,
urges her Suit; and enforcing all that Influence
which in an amiable Woman seldom
fails to succeed with an indulgent Husband
and doating Father, is almost always sure to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
carry her Point. Is not this the Situation
of many a Parent? Is not this the
reigning Practice of many a Son? Of too
many indeed!—The Father here describ’d
is such a one as most Men will acknowledge
to be a tender one; and some will be apt to
think a discreet one; in allowing for the Inconsiderateness
of his Age, weighing like a
prudent Man his real Good, and generously
resolving to furnish him with every reasonable
Means of being wise and happy: still
is he disappointed; and still are his Expectations
frustrated. But need we ask the Cause?
Surely it is too plain. More Pains have
been taken to pamper and humour him,
than to make it unnecessary to do either:
more Time and Care have been employ’d to
furnish his Head, with perhaps merely ornamental
Knowledge, than to correct and
enrich his Heart with such Sentiments as
might improve his Manners. Can we then
wonder that he precipitates into Ruin? No
surely; we may rather wonder if he escapes
it. But admitting that Fortune still favours
him, and that he keeps up his Dignity and
Reputation; how does he possess his own
Mind, as a rational Creature, or a Brute?
Does he act so as to deserve the Esteem
of Mankind? If not, Life is not worth enjoying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>Let us now view the fairer part of our
Species; those tender Branches our Daughters.
They (thank Heaven) are not naturally
so liable to Vices and Extravagancies
as our Sons; but I wish I could say they
were all as good as they are capable of being
made; as amiable in their interior Sentiments,
as their Forms might make us
hope to see them. But alas! too often those
choicest Charms of our Eyes are the chief
Plagues of our Hearts; and it is we ourselves
are the principal Causes, that they whom
Nature seem’d to have form’d to be our principal
Comforts, should thro’ our Mismanagement
become the Disturbers of the Peace
of us their Parents, and of their own Happiness.</p>

<p>A Girl enter’d into the third Septenary
passes soon into a Woman; but commonly
speaking she is much sooner such in her Person
and Appetites than in her Understanding:
whence arise many of those glaring
Mistakes they daily commit. A Girl who
is tall generally conceits she is wise; and because
’till now she has liv’d without controul,
she thinks Subjection and Obedience to her
Parents, mean and slavish. It would be a
Reflection on young Ladies to say they have
no Manners, but still it is too generally true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
that their Manners are false ones; springing
from Pride, and influenc’d by it. A Girl (of
any Figure in Life) soon knows that the
World has it’s Eyes upon her; and as there
are certain Motives which induce her to exert
all her Skill to seem well bred, so there
are certain Times she really appears to advantage:
but let the Mask be thrown off;
let the Restraint be taken away by which
she is confin’d; and we shall soon see where
her Manners lye: we shall (I am afraid) oftentimes
discover that they are not the Dictates
of a well-regulated Heart. But as my
Tenderness for the Sex will not suffer me designedly
to misrepresent things, let us examine
fairly the Conduct of a young Lady
according to the too general Mode of
breeding.</p>

<p>It appears already that the first Stage of
Life was wholly spent in gratifying her
Humour; the second was employ’d in a superficial
Education, resembling in some measure
a Building ornamented without, but ill
contriv’d and useless within. Self-will, Vanity
and Pleasure have hitherto been her
Guides; and these instead of being check’d,
are in the third Stage, greatly strengthen’d
and augmented: and have besides added to
them a boundless Love of Power and Uncontroul.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
Now from such a Source what
Virtues can we expect to flow? What Miseries
may we not fear? Alas! too soon are
we convinc’d that her whole Soul is absorb’d
in Pleasures; her Head runs round with
them; she is continually contriving, plotting,
scheming; and all Opposition of her
Parents becomes too weak: she has not,
perhaps, a Spark of real Duty, nor the least
Sense of her misguided Steps: and happy is
it for her if her mistaken Conduct does
not in the End plunge her into Sorrow too
great to support. Happy is it for her if the
Stream of Pleasure she is borne down with
does not insensibly carry away her Honour
and Virtue; or at least dash her on the fatal
Rock of a miserable Marriage. Wherever
this Portrait is found to be genuine, let it be
remember’d, that the Painter who draws a
real Likeness ought not to be blam’d for the
Disagreeableness of the Features.</p>

<p>Many, it is true, have Fortune to support
their Pleasures, however expensive or
irregular; but where that fails, where Fortune
is small, and the Propensity to Pleasure
great, Honour and Virtue stand so very tottering,
that they are in perpetual Danger:
and if with this unbridled Love of Pleasure,
there be a tolerable share of Wit or Beauty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
or both; who that reflects, can help trembling
even at the Apprehension of a Fall?
But tho’ a young Lady should escape those
innumerable Calamities which her giddy
Conduct has laid her open to, what Hopes
are there, that she who has never borne Contradiction,
will so demean herself as to become
amiable in the Eyes of others, or be
happy in herself?</p>

<p>I could with great facility delineate a variety
of shapes hideous to behold, which
young People of both Sexes shew themselves
in, when guided only by their Passions;
but, to avoid Prolixity, will content
myself with the general View I have already
presented; and proceed to lay down such
Rules as appear to me to tend most directly
and securely to the avoiding the various
Evils our Children are subject to,
and seem most conducive to their real
Happiness. But before I lay down any
Precepts let me premise, that all Laws in
general give Parents the sole supreme Power
of governing their Children: ’tis the Order
of Nature; and if her Laws are inverted,
nothing but Confusion follows. If then Parents
do not govern their Children at all; or
what is worse, let their Children govern
them, which is often the Case, the almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
unavoidable Consequence will be, that Train
of Irregularities and Disorders we daily see
them run into; in which Case, there are
but two Ways of their becoming sensible of
their mistake: either from a natural Goodness
of Heart awakened by Time and Experience;
or from a load of Misfortunes crushing
them down for want of Power to support
them: now the one we ought not to
trust to; and the other we should bend all
our Study to prevent.</p>

<h2>HEALTH.</h2>

<p>Tho’ the principal Design of this Attempt
be that of regulating the Manners
of Children; yet as Health and
Education are of vast Importance in the
Government of them, and are closely connected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
therewith; I think myself oblig’d to
speak of what may tend to preserve the one,
and, in a due Degree, promote the other.
For the sake of Method I shall divide my
Subject into three Parts; that is, range it
under the general Heads of Health, Manners,
and Education; which to me appears
to be the only natural Order of treating it.
Mr. <i>Locke</i>, it is true, in his Treatise on this
Subject, calls the whole, Thoughts on Education;
but notwithstanding that general
Title to his Book, he speaks likewise of
Health and Manners, and ranges them all
in the Order here propos’d.</p>

<p>As Health is the reverse of Sickness, my
Readers will easily discern that it is not the
Business of this Undertaking to invade the
Physician’s Province, by entering on the
Cure of Diseases; but only to point out such
Means as seem to have the most rational tendency
to prevent them.</p>

<p>First then, I earnestly recommend to
both Father and Mother, that their Children
suck the Mother’s Breast. But why,
you’ll say, take pains to address each Parent
distinctly? The reason is obvious. A Man
cannot be conversant in Life, and not see
that many a sensible Woman, many a tender<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Mother, has her Heart yearning to
suckle her Child, and is prevented by the
misplac’d Authority of a Husband. Parents
upon the whole are to be consider’d as
equally and mutually concern’d in the training
up their Children; therefore when I
address them by that one common Epithet,
I mean either, or both. But there are, both
in Nature and Reason, certain Provinces assign’d
to each; and a Man’s attempting to
overturn them, would be as absurd and preposterous,
as a Merchant’s sending his Wife
to transact Business upon Change, while he
stay’d at home to preside over the Nursery.</p>

<p>Providence, we see, without any Expence
to us, kindly sends Food into the World
along with the Child, by giving to the Mother
a Breast flowing with Milk. But to
what purpose is this bestow’d? To be neglected
and render’d fruitless? No surely;
we cannot think thus indignantly of so great
a Blessing. But besides this evident Design
of Providence, there is another important
Consideration; which is, that Mothers by
suckling their Children cherish that Tenderness
which Nature has implanted in them
towards their Offspring. For Experience
shews, that the Office of suckling considerably
augments in them the Affection from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
whence that Tenderness flows; serves as Fuel
to keep their fond Breasts in one perpetual
Glow; and by sweetening their Care, enables
them likewise to bring the tender Infants
thro’ their helpless Age?</p>

<p>Another Argument for suckling, which
is not sufficiently attended to, because not
sufficiently known, is, that the Anxiety and
Fatigue is perhaps fully compensated by the
Pleasure. The provident Author of Nature
has order’d in this, as in all, or most other
Things, right and natural, that the Inducement
shall more than balance the Discouragement.
All Mothers who have experienc’d
it, whose Minds are temper’d with
natural Affection, assure us, that there is an
inexpressible Pleasure in giving Suck, which
none but Mothers know; for besides that
the Sensation itself is said to be mighty
pleasing; to behold the Innocence, the Cunning,
the Tricks, and the various Whims
of a Child; to observe likewise the early
Sentiments they discover; must doubtless
give a Pleasure which no Words can describe.
Now if thus much be granted (and
surely no Arguments can reason it away) I
cannot help advising in the strongest Terms,
that every Father consent, and even promote,
that the Child be suckled by it’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Mother; if the Mother be in a Condition
for it. But then, this Compliance, this
Leave, if I must call it such, should be cordial,
and from the Heart; otherwise a Mother,
tho’ the best Nurse in the World, may
become the most improper one, by a Husband’s
so far souring her Temper, as to render
her Milk, not only good for nothing,
but even pernicious.</p>

<p>The general Good of all being what I
aim at, I mean to offer the same Advice to
all, as far as it can be practised; and therefore
speak according to the Nature of
Things. Still I am not insensible how little
Probability there is that my Advice herein
will be follow’d by Persons in high Life.
For what Room is there in general to hope,
that a fine Lady will lay herself under any
of the necessary Restraints towards acting the
Part of a good Nurse, and generously give
up some of the vainer Pleasures of Life, in
order to stoop to this Part of domestic Care?
It is true that there may sometimes be important
Reasons which may make their doing
so improper; but it is greatly to be
fear’d that those Reasons are oftener affected
than real; and as this is a Duty not so easily
dispensed with as People are apt to imagine,
it is incumbent on Parents of the highest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Rank to consider how far they are really justifiable
in deviating from the Laws of Nature.
But there is another important Consequence
attends the Neglect with which People of
Rank treat their Offspring in this Particular;
that it thereby becomes a national Evil. It
is universally known that the Little imitate
the Great, and mostly too in what is wrong;
that is, they catch their Vices sooner than
their Virtues. Hence it happens, that because
a Woman of the first Rank does not
deign to suckle her Child, the Neglect descends
to almost the lowest Rank; and
many Men whose Figure in Life is very inconsiderable,
scorn to bear the Noise of a
Child, tho’ their own Flesh and Blood, only
because it is a Practice among their Betters
to remove them. And hence too the Great
have two Reflections to make on this Point,
the Duty they owe to their Children, and,
(tho’ perhaps it is not a proper Observation
here) the Influence which a Neglect of this
Duty has on all beneath them.</p>

<p>While I am enforcing to Mothers the
Duty of suckling their Children, I must endeavour
to omit no material Circumstance,
either that will contribute to the Ease of the
one, or the Advantage of the other. The
first that naturally occurs, is, the Time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
when a Child should be put to the Breast:
and as this is a Matter variously thought of,
and often erroneously managed, tho’ I could
say a good deal from my own Observation,
I have endeavour’d to settle it upon a much
stronger Basis, <i>viz.</i> the Experience of competent
Judges. Dr. <i>Hunter</i>, well known to
the Public both by his Lectures in Anatomy,
and his Practice in Midwifry, and
one of the Men-Midwives of the Lying-in-Hospital
in <i>Brownlow-Street</i>, informs me,
that at the first opening of that Charity,
they generally conducted the Business of
suckling in the following Manner. The
Child was not put to the Breast till the Milk
came freely, or run out of itself; and as
the Breasts commonly began to fill in about
eight and forty Hours after Delivery, sooner
or later, they were allowed to fill more and
more, perhaps as much longer, ’till the
Milk began to discharge itself: to forward
this, the Breasts were frequently embrocated
with warm Oil; to invite the Milk both by
the Softness of the Oil, and the Motion
given the Breasts by rubbing it in with the
Hand. This Method was adhered to pretty
generally, ’till they found by Experience that
it was wrong. For besides that the Child
might probably suffer in some Degree, by
being so long depriv’d of it’s most natural
Physick and Food, many grievous Effects
often attend the Mother; <i>viz.</i> painful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Swellings and Inflammations of the Breasts,
Milk Fevers, and Milk Sores.</p>

<p>These Inconveniences induced the Physicians
of that Hospital to alter the Method,
which for some Time past has
been as follows. The Child is put to the
Breast commonly within twenty-four Hours
after Delivery: and tho’ at first it sucks little,
and that only a thin Serum, (which
however is of singular Service to the Infant
by discharging the <i>Meconium</i> that fills the
large Intestines) yet the Advantage to the
Mother is, that by this means the Milk
comes gradually and kindly; and before the
usual Time of the Breasts hardening in the
other Method, the Difficulty is conquered
in this; the Milk flows freely, the Breasts
are soft and easy, and the Heat of the Body
continues temperate: insomuch that Dr.
<i>Hunter</i> farther assures me, that there has
been much less of Inflammations of the
Breasts and Milk fevers, and but one Milk
Sore among upwards of fourteen hundred
Women that have been deliver’d there
since this Method has been pursued.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Here, tho’ it is a Digression from my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Subject, I cannot help reflecting with Pleasure
on the Benefit arising to many industrious
virtuous People from the Institution of
this Hospital. Every Charitable Foundation,
every Contribution to relieve the
Needy, does Honour not only to those who
give, but to the Nation where it is given;
for when Individuals are known to be humane
and benevolent, Strangers will conclude
it as a national Virtue. It is certain
that all public Receptacles for the Comfort
and Support of the Distressed Indigent argue
a compassionate Heart in those who support
them, and a just Sense of others Woe; but
the Lying-in-Hospital has a Delicacy in it
peculiar to itself. The Ladies who contribute
to it’s Support, prove, in Terms far
more expressive than Words, their Sympathy
with the Sufferings of their Sex; and
particularly with those whom Fortune has
placed the farthest from them. The Gentlemen
who encourage it, and labour for it’s
Promotion, shew a Tenderness which can
only dwell in manly Hearts: for he certainly
comes nearest to the Dignity of a Man,
who has the tenderest Sense of the Sufferings
of the opposite Sex; and particularly of
those, which his own Existence is the necessary
Cause of. But farther, most other
Public Charities seem in their Nature limited;
seem to extend no farther than the immediate
Relief of those under their Care; whereas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
this is far more extensive: the Mother is
comforted, and with tenderest Care brought
thro’ her Child-bed; the Child (as far as
Skill can reach) is safely entered on the
Stage of Life; and thus is Mankind not
only preserved, but perpetuated; and thus
too is Society enlarged, and improved, to
a boundless Degree. Thus much have I
said to do justice to an Undertaking in itself
highly laudable, and infallibly productive of
the greatest Good. But there is another Effect,
perhaps hitherto unthought of, which
will necessarily attend this Hospital, and is
no less than a general Concern; that of the
Improvement of Midwifry: the several
Gentlemen who attend it in that Capacity,
cannot but have the best Foundation in their
Art, that which is extended and strengthened
by the frequent Occurrence of the more
nice and uncommon Cases among such Variety:
and the Women whom they educate
to Midwifry in that Hospital, must from
their many Opportunities become valuable
Practitioners for such of their Sex as are inclined
to employ them rather than a Man.</p>

<p>But to return to the Matter in hand.
This Method of putting Children to the
Breast much sooner than usual, corresponds
with the Opinion of Dr. <i>Cadogan</i>, who in a
small Pamphlet on the Management of Children,
has said a great many sensible useful
Things; and among the rest, he proposes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
that a Child be put to the Breast in seven or
eight Hours after it is born; whereby, says
he, “It would not only provide for itself
the best of Nourishment, but by opening
a free Passage for it, take off the Mother’s
Load as it increased, before it could oppress
or hurt her; and therefore effectually
prevent the Fever; which is caus’d
only by the painful Distention of the lacteal
Vessels of the Breasts, when the Milk
is injudiciously suffer’d to accumulate.”
To this I have two Things to add; First,
to recommend to Parents that the Advice
here given be reduced to Practice, unless
some extraordinary Circumstances intervene;
in which Case, their own Judgment must
direct them to seek an Opinion suitable to
the Exigence. Secondly, that all Precautions
be taken to prevent the Mother’s
catching Cold, or being too much fatigued
in the first Days after Delivery. It is here meant,
besides the Child’s having it’s most proper
Nourishment, the Breast, as soon as possible;
that the Mother be secured not only from
the Danger of sore Breasts, but even from
Inflammations and Fevers so common to the
Sex in Child-bed. But while we are guarding
against Mischief one way, it is no less
our Duty to prevent it, if possible, every
way; therefore do I again caution that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
utmost Care be taken to prevent the Mother’s
catching Cold, or sitting up in Bed
too long for her Strength in the first Attempts
to suckle her Child. It is common
for a Child, when first put to the Breast, to
be unapt; the Mother, especially if a young
one, is often awkward; and if the Nurse be
unhandy or careless, the Consequences may
be fatal; and indeed frequently are so: the
Reason is plain. The Perspiration which
usually follows Delivery is necessary; and
where Nature is defective, Art is employ’d
to keep it up: if then these Sweats are salutary,
whatever obstructs or checks them
must be dangerous; and nothing sooner or
more certainly effects this than the being
injudiciously uncover’d. But besides catching
Cold, there is great Danger to be apprehended
from Fatigue. That too much Fatigue
in these early Days after Delivery may
be very pernicious, every body knows who
is experienced. Nothing so common as a
Woman’s having had a good Labour, and
being so extremely well, that on the second,
third, or fourth Day she indulges herself
with the Conversation of a Friend, or sits up
in Bed for some time for Refreshment; in
Consequence of which she grows hot, has a
restless Night, and before Morning is in a
raging Fever; perhaps delirious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>The precise Time of a Child’s sucking is
a Point much controverted, particularly among
Ladies, but nothing ascertain’d. The
present Fashion ’tis true, is to let Children
suck only three or four Months; but surely
this is too important an affair for Fashion to
take place of Reason. From my Acquaintance
with the Learned on this Head, I gather,
that generally speaking a Child should
not suck less than six Months, nor more than
twelve; but that the Medium, that is, nine
Months, is for the most part the best. Still
there may be Reasons for varying these stated
Times; if so, Reason in that as well as
in other things should be our Guide. And
farther, there may be Circumstances which
impede the Mother’s suckling her Child at
all; the want of Health is a principal one;
but then it should be a real want of Health,
not an imaginary one. Where then a Doubt
arises, I advise Parents not rashly and hastily
to resolve for themselves, but to consult
proper Judges, and always, where it is in
their Power, be determined by their Physician.</p>

<p>But here, as an Encouragement to Mothers
to suckle their Children, I must observe,
that it is the Opinion of Physicians
that many Women would mend their Health
by it; and very few, if any, hurt a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
Constitution, unless thro’ Imprudence or Ignorance:
now to obviate these, let Mothers
be careful to set out right, and then they
have very little to fear.</p>

<p>Hunger, Fatigue, and Fretting, are the
three most obvious things that impair a Mother’s
Health in Nursing. I say nothing of
gross Intemperance, violent Passions, and
the like, for they are always to be banish’d;
nay we are not once to suppose they exist in
the Sex. Hunger is carefully to be avoided:
while the Mother gives suck, she should
never let the Keenness of her Appetite go
off by waiting long for her Meals; for that
often repeated will sink the Spirits, fill her
with Wind, impair her Strength, and consequently
not only hurt herself, but prejudice
her Milk also.</p>

<p>I confess it is my Opinion that a very nice
regard to a Nurse’s Diet is not so generally
necessary as is imagined. Temperance is
universally to be held as a Rule; but under
the appearance of avoiding one Error, they
run into a greater; they often eat of very
rich Dishes, and shun the use of Vegetables:
whereas to People who are young and
healthy, nothing is more wholsome than Vegetables
blended with Meat: and the only
Caution that is material to be given, is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
that they guard them with Pepper; whereby
they will keep under the Effect they
sometimes have, of producing Wind. But
should Garden Stuff, after all this, disagree,
Prudence will certainly direct the Mother to
disuse it; tho’ at the same time it must be
own’d, that where this is the Case, her Digestion
is not what it ought to be to constitute
perfect Health. To this Head I will
add, that where a Woman has been accustom’d
to drink a glass or two of Wine or
Ale at Meals, she should not debar herself
from it now; as her waste of Strength and
Spirits certainly demand at least her usual
way of Life; tho’ it does not seem needful
for her to go far beyond it.</p>

<p>By Fatigue I mean so much Exercise as
manifestly impairs the Strength, or brings
on various Pains, so as to render a Mother
incapable of executing what she has begun;
or at least makes the Office extremely slavish
to her. Exercise is good, but Fatigue is
bad. There are so many different Conditions
in this great Family of the World,
and so many different Circumstances in each
Station, that it is impossible to lay down
Rules for every Individual, or prescribe an
universal one for all; in general I recommend
on this occasion the joint Attention of
both Father and Mother. If a Man reflects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
that while his Wife is suckling her Child,
she is labouring to compleat the principal
Work for which they came together, he
cannot surely suffer her to endure Fatigue
beyond her Power to bear; nor can he feel
for her that Tenderness he ought, if he imposes
any Hardship on her that can be dispens’d
with. On the other hand, the Mother
is to remember, that besides being
chearful and keeping her Mind at rest, she
must keep her Limbs at rest too; that is,
she must often forego other Exercise, that
she may be enabled to bestow a larger Portion
of Kindness on her Child.</p>

<p>But there are several ways a Woman may
be fatigued with Nursing without the least
necessity. The first thing a Mother has to
do, is, to use her Child to such Positions in
suckling as she likes best, and is most convenient
to herself. When up, the Mother
should by all means sit upright, and the
Child be rais’d to the Breast: the Child
should yield to the Mother, and not the
Mother to the Child. That distorted Posture
so commonly seen in suckling gives great
Pain to the Back, and cramps all the Limbs;
and this without any other effect on the
Child than indulging a manifest Wilfulness.
When in Bed, the Child should take the
Breast as it lyes; and not incommode the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Mother by making her sit up in Bed by the
Hour, purely to humour it, as is too common:
for this too, without any Benefit to
the Child, greatly increases the Mother’s
Fatigue, by robbing her of her Sleep, and
by exposing her to catch Cold from the various
Seasons it happens in. But these Inconveniences
may farther be obviated, by
letting the Child lye in a Cradle without the
Breast the Night thro’, or with a Maid in
another Room; for it is certain, that neither
Breast, Drink, nor Feeding are so absolutely
necessary in the Night as is commonly
imagin’d. Some of my fair Readers
will, I doubt, reject my Counsel in this particular;
but I urge it on the double Motive
of Benefit to the Child, and Ease to the
Mother. Yet not to be too rigorous in this
Point, not to affect too sensibly a Mother’s
Tenderness, suppose a Child be sometimes
allow’d the Breast in the Night, it certainly
should be only sometimes; for the Practice
of letting it drag at it the Night thro’ is a
grievous Error: it hurts both Child and
Mother; the Child by this Means is continually
wrangling, fretting, and dissatisfy’d,
and the Mother is often so sensibly affected by
it, as even to be thrown into Hysteric Fits.</p>

<p>Difficult as I acknowledge it is to lay
down an universal Rule, I will here attempt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
what appears to me to be generally practicable.
According to the usual Management
of Children at the Breast it may be averr’d,
that they have too little Sleep, and too much
Food: that is, their Sleep is short and
broken thro’ Mismanagement, and they are
suckled or fed oftener than is conducive to
Health. Now to remove this Error, I will
not offer any Restraint in the Day-time,
(tho’ that in the opinion of an ingenious
Writer<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> requires it) but endeavour to effect
it by regulating the Night. To this
End let a Child be undress’d, it’s Night
things put on, and be fed or suckled at seven
o’Clock, and then put into it’s Cradle;
where without rocking (if used to it and in
Health) it will fall asleep. Supposing the
Mother to go to Bed at ten or eleven, if the
Child should happen to be awake, let it be
turn’d dry (as the Nurses term it) and
suckled again; and it will sleep soundly for
six or seven Hours: perhaps now and then
it will whimper a little, but if it is not
touch’d it will fall asleep again immediately.
But supposing it is not awake when the Mother
goes to Bed, let it not by any means be
disturb’d, for that breaking of Childrens
Rest so common with Parents makes them
vastly tiresome; all that the Mother has to
do in this Case is, to keep a warm Cloth in
Bed with her, and when the Child awakes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
take away the wet one as soon as possible,
that it may not be too much disturb’d by
the Sense of Cold; that done, let it have the
Breast, and it will commonly sleep again till
it is time for the Family to rise. The Child
should not have its Cloth shifted again; for
frequently opening it when it ought to sleep
is a great Impediment to it’s Rest; and while
wrapt up warm, and it lies still, it receives
no Harm from being wet: to this must be
added, that the Mother be very hush; no
talking, no shewing the Candle, the Daylight,
or any thing that may awaken it
thoroughly. If this Method be adher’d to,
I am persuaded it will have many good Effects;
it will give a longer respite than usual
from feeding or suckling; it will obtain
what is of great Consequence to a Child’s
Health, Sleep; and it will facilitate the Mother’s
Task by lessening her Fatigue.</p>

<p>To suffer by Hunger or Fatigue does
great injury to the Mother principally, but
Fretting has always a double Consequence;
it hurts the Child too. A fretful Temper
turns even Pleasure into Pain; well then
may it make a necessary Care a Fatigue.
One Distinction however I would make that
I think deserves Attention; whether the
Fretfulness be in Nature, be fixt and incurable;
or whether it be owing to external<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
Accidents, the Occurrences of Things;
such as frequent Provocations from a Husband,
untoward Children, wasteful Servants,
vexatious Law Suits, and many other
Evils Life is fraught with. In the first Case,
Women would do well to let suckling alone;
for warm as I am in recommending this
Practice, it is certain there are some few Exceptions,
and this is one. But in the other,
I urge suckling in great measure as a Remedy.
For let the naturally good-temper’d
Mother but once reflect that Fretting hurts
her Child, and she will avoid it for her Infant’s
sake: besides, the Love created in
her for it by the Exercise of this natural
Duty, will make her forget many other
Cares; at least it will counterpoise her Troubles,
by mingling Pleasure with Pain.</p>

<p>There is a Class of Women who are lifeless
and sluggish, an insipid Race that do
neither good nor harm; these should by all
means suckle their Children, for by so doing
they would be enliven’d, and animated with
a Desire to become useful. If too they reflect,
that the Intention of Nature is, that
they should rear their Children as well as
bear them, they will soon be ashamed of doing
their Work by halves: and thus become
much happier in themselves, and of much
more Consequence to Society.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>By the Observance of these few Rules,
Mothers in general may suckle their Children,
not only without Pain or Injury, but
even with Pleasure and Profit. They may
sometimes improve their Health; often
lessen their Cares, and mend their Temper
and Dispositions; and will always have a
pleasing Consciousness that they have obey’d
the Laws of Nature, by having done all that
was incumbent on them.</p>

<p>If after all that has been said it is not
thought expedient that a Child should suck
it’s Mother; a Breast is certainly the best
Substitute: but great Care should here be
taken, in the Choice of a Nurse. She should
be young, healthy, good-humour’d, sprightly,
and temperate. The newer her Milk
the better; it is best not to be above three
Months old; and should never exceed six
Months, when the Child is first put to her
Breast; if beyond that, either the Child
must be wean’d too soon, or suck a staler
Milk than perhaps it ought. Some are of
Opinion, that Breast-milk begins to lose
of it’s nutritious Quality after the Expiration
of a Year; but let us here observe the
Operations of Nature. The younger Breast-Milk
is, the thinner and lighter it is; fitted
by Nature for the tender Stomachs of new-born<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Babes: as it grows older, it becomes
thicker, richer, and more stubborn of Digestion;
by which gradual Change it is
suited to the relative rising Powers of Digestion
in the Child. Hence it would seem,
that Breast-milk, does not at this stated
Time become poorer, but richer; rich perhaps
to a degree of Rancidity; which, like
gross Food to others, is sometimes stronger
than Children can bear: and on this Principle
it is I recommend where a Breast is to be
sought, that either the Milk be young, or
the Child wean’d soon.</p>

<p>But supposing a Child to have no Breast
(as Arguments whether good or bad will often
be brought against it) the want of it
must be supply’d by coming as near to Nature
as we can. In order thereto, it is the
Opinion of a Physician<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> in the Practice of
Midwifry, whose Judgment in this Matter
ought to have weight, that Cows-milk be
diluted with Water, ’till it becomes as thin
as Breast-milk, and given warm several
times in the Day; that is, as often as a
Child would have the Breast were it to be
suckled: besides this, it should sometimes
be fed with other Milk Diet; viz. Bread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
and Water boil’d lightly together, and Milk
added to it.</p>

<p>When a Child sucks it is usual to feed it
with nothing but Water Pap, that is, Bread
and Water boil’d together, without the Addition
of Milk; from a Notion that it
should not have two sorts of Milk; but this
Treatment is surely erroneous. Nay, there
are some who improve upon this Error, and
give their Children (at least for the first
Month) Water Pap only, even tho’ they
have no Breast.</p>

<p>It is both natural and commendable in
Parents to inform themselves what Distempers
Children are subject to, and usually dye
of; and if we farther refer them to the Bills
of Mortality, they will constantly find, that
Gripes, Looseness, and Convulsions make a
great Part of the Account. Now besides
the latent Causes of these Diseases, they
have a very obvious one, <i>viz.</i> improper
Food. For my own part I am convinc’d,
even to Demonstration, that many Infants
owe their Death to the Mistakes committed
in this Point; and often to the false Practice
of giving them Bread and Water only,
and omitting that most salutary part the
Milk. Milk (again I repeat it) is the Food<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
of Nature; with that alone, to an Infant,
we may do almost every thing; without it,
nothing.</p>

<p>Tho’ these first Rules here laid down
should meet with general Approbation, and
Parents from seeing how natural and reasonable
this Doctrine is, be induced to follow
it; they have still many things both to do
and avoid, that are greatly conducive to
their Childrens Health; and therefore demand
their Attention and Regard.</p>

<p>As we have urg’d that Milk is the Food
of Nature, so we may with equal Propriety
call Bread the Staff of Life. Breast-milk
my Readers will observe, is preferred to
every other; but where that cannot be obtain’d,
then Cows-milk, made thinner and
lighter by the Addition of Water, is to supply
its place; and, between whiles, the
Child is to be fed with Milk-victuals; from
which, as it is thicken’d with Bread, it will
receive great Nourishment. But here great
care must be taken to keep up its Appetite
for this Food at first setting out; as it is of
all others the most proper; and not spoil its
Relish for it by the Admixture or Intervention
of any thing else while in Health, ’till
a more advanc’d Age.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>The first Error usually run into, is, the
immoderate use of Spice and Sugar; which
Physicians who have consider’d these matters
positively condemn: and if a Child is well,
putting either of these in it’s Victuals, answers
not the least good End. Spice and Sugar
are certainly fine natural Productions, and
of vast Use to Mankind; but the Food of
Infants should be as simple as possible; and
if it is made otherwise by the early use of
these, the Effects will always be very troublesome,
and oftentimes mischievous. What
is more common than to give young Children
Lumps of Sugar to eat; yet what more
erroneous? Every Day’s Experience shews
us how wrong the Practice is: it vitiates
their Taste; creates in them an unconquerable
Fondness for it, even to a Degree
of Vulgarness; and manifestly clogs their
Stomachs.</p>

<p>The Error next in rank to these, or rather
a part of the same, as Sugar is greatly
concern’d in it, is, the Custom Parents
have of giving Children Tea. Tea, to a
young Child, if we omit the Milk, has not
a single Ingredient to recommend it: the
Sugar in it has already been treated of; the
Water, (as Tea is usually drank too hot,)
serves to scald it’s Mouth and Throat, or at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
best to relax the Stomach and weaken the
Tone of it; and the Plant or Shrub it self
has Qualities, which, to say the least of it,
seldom contributes to promote it’s Health.</p>

<p>That this Herb of which our Tea is made
has had many Tongues to speak it’s Praise,
I am convinc’d; or it would not have obtain’d
that universal use we now see made of
it: and some likewise have taken up their
Pen, and with great Labour describ’d its
Virtues and Utility to Mankind: but all
this is too weak to stand against that infallible
Guide, Experience. To insist that
Tea has no good Qualities would be offering
an Affront to the Judgment and Experience
of many wise People, and is very far
from being my Design; on the contrary, I
am convinc’d it has. Bohea Tea is esteem’d
balsamic, and Green is allow’d to be an
astringent Stomachic. Still these or any
other particular Qualities, do not justify it’s
general use; for while the same Experience
proves that for one who receives Benefit by
drinking it, ten receive Harm, it must upon
the Whole be condemned.</p>

<p>Tea may be consider’d like some certain
Drugs, which in skilful hands are safe and
useful, but in ignorant ones, poisonous.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
That the intemperate and indiscriminate use
of Tea is hurtful, is too well known to be
disputed; some it is true are manifestly
refresh’d, comforted and enliven’d by it;
others feel not the least sensible effect from
the longest use of it, and drink it purely
thro’ Custom; but again there are others,
and those much the Majority, who impair
their Health so visibly by this pernicious
Practice, that they shorten their Lives, or
at least render them comfortless, if not miserable.
Now who that considers these
things well, or but once reflects that ’tis at
least ten to one that their Children are Sufferers
by it, can reasonably speaking be
hasty in bringing them to it; especially too if
we farther reflect, that by a seeming magic
Power it often enslaves People even to Infatuation.
Infants then have nothing to do with
this darling deluding Liquor; and when at
a more advanc’d Age, Parents should still
give it them very sparingly, if at all; and be
careful to keep them if possible from ever
being attach’d to it.</p>

<p>Before I take my leave of this Article, let
me recommend to Parents some Observations
for their farther guidance herein. Those Children
who have weak Nerves should not by
any means drink Tea at all. Tea should never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
be made strong; nor drank in large quantities,
nor hot, nor without Milk, nor very
sweet. Tea should not be drank in a Morning
by those who cannot eat; nor can it in
general be drank in the Afternoon with Safety,
but by those who have eat a hearty Dinner,
and drink it soon. Bohea Tea is found
to affect the Nerves the most sensibly; and
Green, from its Astringency, is not only the
most grateful, but its Effects prove it to be
least hurtful.</p>

<p>Many are the Errors which Parents fall
into in the Management of Children, especially
at first setting out. I have often seen
Children wash’d away with the watry Gripes,
when upon inquiry it appear’d they had no
other Food but Water Pap: others reject this,
and fall into the Error of giving Children
Broth; which alone, is in it’s Nature too laxative
for Infants. But Water Pap must be
condemn’d as far the most improper; for it
is manifest that Bread, of which it is made,
besides the Fermentation it undergoes in the
Hands of the Baker, has, according to the
Juices it meets with, a farther Power of fermenting
in the Stomach: therefore, should
Nature by chance be thwarted, should universal
Observation be for once contradicted,
by shewing a Child whom Milk is unfit for;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
in that case I recommend, that Broth be
added to the Pap; which will bring the Food
nearest to the Quality of that animal Fluid,
Milk, the natural Nourishment. And as
watry Gripes are often owing to ill-digested
Pap, Broth, tho’ laxative, would certainly
from its Smoothness prevent or lessen the
Stimulation in the Bowels; as we find in the
Cure of such Gripes great Service from
Glysters of Oil, Chickens-guts, and other
things of the like Kind.</p>

<p>But farther; I am clearly of Opinion,
that the first Change in Childrens Diet should
be from Milk to Broth, and not from Milk
to Meat: their tender Stomachs ought not
to be put too early upon the Office of digesting
the fleshy Fibres of Meat; but they
may, as they approach to a Year old, by way
of Introduction to eating Flesh, and by way
of changing Diet, sometimes have Broth;
but by no means for constant use, to the
neglect of Milk.</p>

<p>It is universally confess’d, that in <i>England</i>
we eat too much Flesh; and were I to urge
all that might be said on that Head, it
would be dwelling too long on a single Point.
But since this Error of our Country is acknowledg’d
by many of the wisest Men in it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
let it serve as a general Caution to Parents;
let them turn it to the Advantage of the rising
Generation; by being neither hasty in
giving Flesh Meat to their Children, nor
even permitting them to be intemperate in
the Use of it.</p>

<p>To enforce this Precept, and prove the
Reasonableness of not giving Children Meat
so soon as is usual, I will here observe, that
Physicians say the first Digestion should be in
the Mouth, the second in the Stomach;
whence it appears that Children have no Business
with Meat ’till they have Teeth to
chew it; nay, not ’till they have their
Mouths almost full of Teeth; for they have
not the Power of grinding down their Meat
sufficiently ’till they have got some of their
strongest Teeth, and those every one is sensible
do not come first. Hence we are furnished
with an admirable Hint, which not to
endeavour to reduce to Practice, would be
injuring our Children, and baffling the Labours
of learned Men, who make the Good
of Mankind the Study of their Lives. Parents
by the same Lesson are instructed likewise,
to make their Children accustom themselves
to chew their Meat well their whole
Lives; for it is certain they would thereby<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
prevent many ill Effects arising from Indigestion.</p>

<p>Having thus, as near to Nature as I am
able, led Parents into the first Steps of the
Management of their Childrens Health, I
shall now touch on Art; a little of which
may, and will be necessary. It is plain that
Children are born full of Foulness, full of
Excrement; and Nature to remedy this,
gives a purgative Quality to the Mother’s
first Milk; which Quality, as the Child
cleanses, goes off. But if this first Milk
be drawn away by another, as is frequent,
in order to ease the Breasts; or the Child
does not suck it’s Mother, but an older Milk;
in that Case it should most certainly be purged
three or four times in the Month. For
my own Part I have gone farther, and tho’
my Children had the first Milk, I always
began by giving them a little Syrup of Rhubarb
and Oil of Almonds; which has constantly
had a good Effect, not only on them,
but on many others under my Care: the
Rhubarb scours and cleanses them, and the
Oil in some measure blunts its griping Quality,
and prevents its leaving a Costiveness so
common to that Drug. But tho’ I have frequently
given this, yet Rhubarb in Substance,
corrected with a small Portion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
Aromatic, or mix’d with Gascoign’s Powder,
is found by Experience to agree very well:
Syrup of Violets or Marshmallows, join’d
with Oil of Almonds, are frequently given
in order to cleanse the first Passages, and are
very proper; tho’ not so efficacious as Rhubarb.
Nor are there any better Purges than
these for new-born Infants, unless, (which
very seldom happens) in great Costiveness,
and then a little Manna. What farther relates
to Physic and physical People, shall be
spoken of hereafter.</p>

<p>In a Treatise of this Kind nothing must
pass unobserved that is important; and nothing
is more so, than the destructive Practice
of drinking spirituous Liquors. For a
Woman to have a Habit of Dram-drinking
is always detestable; but for one who gives
Suck, it is horrible beyond Expression: it
is fraught with double Mischief, Destruction
to herself, and Destruction to the Child.
One would imagine, that so odious a Vice
wanted not to be inveigh’d against; or at
most that the Caution could no where be
useful, but amongst Basket-women and Billingsgates.
’Tis true indeed, that the Illiterate
and Vulgar are the most addicted to it;
but melancholy Experience shews us, that
Women every way happy in Life, Women
of the best Understanding, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
best Education, are but too often tainted
with it.</p>

<p>It is not my Design in general to write on
the Foibles or Vices of Parents, but of
Children; yet it must be owned, that where
the Actions of the one have an Influence on
the other, where the Connection is so close
that the Health or Morals of Children are
affected by the Conduct of Parents, it is perfectly
consistent with the Plan I have laid
down; and consequently is within my Province.
Thus then I observe, that there are
many Women who never tasted spirituous
Liquors ’till they gave Suck. A Child is
kept lugging at the Breast ’till the Mother
is ready to sink, and a Friend recommends
a Dram: the innocent Woman starts at the
Proposition; but it being strenuously urg’d
that it will do her good and the Child too,
she follows the Counsel and drinks it. How
reluctantly and with how much dislike may
be known by her shaking her Head at the
very Smell of it, making Faces when it is
down, and declaring it is nasty Stuff. Now
for a while let me talk like an Apothecary.
The Nerves give Sensation to our whole
Frame whether of Pain or Pleasure. This
Dram acts immediately on the Nerves of the
Stomach, and instantly communicates itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
to those of the Brain, which are exquisitely
fine; the Sensation is pleasing, a general
Glow is felt, and the temporary Relief it
gives, persuades her that Drams are not so
pernicious as People pretend. But by and
by the Languor returns, and she has recourse
to her Dram again; tho’ perhaps
with this Difference, that instead of being
persuaded into it she seeks it herself; and
thus by a Return of Wants, she finds a Return
of Desire; she flies so often to her fancied
Remedy, that at length she is innocently
and insensibly led into a Habit which infatuates
her: even so far as often to rob her
of the Power of getting rid of it. But the
Habit contracted, what is the Effect? Why,
that which at first was only a slight Injury,
by this means becomes a mortal Wound.</p>

<p>The Human Frame, that Master-Piece
of infinite Wisdom, is compos’d of a great
variety of Parts, of different Make, Texture
and Quality; each of which has it’s
Use, and proper Office assign’d it. But that
I may not confound any of my Readers by
nice or obscure Physical Divisions, I will
say it is compos’d of Solids and Fluids: the
Fluids, that is, the Blood and other Juices,
are allotted to nourish and preserve the Solids;
and the Solids, that is, the Flesh and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
other hard Parts, serve as Pipes or Channels
to convey in a due Course the several Fluids
to their destin’d End. Now to preserve
Health, it is necessary that our whole Machine
acts regularly; which it cannot do
for any long Time with the pernicious Habit
we have been speaking of. Drams, which
at first give only a slight Wound to the
Nerves, by frequent Repetition enfeeble
them; and in the End totally disable them;
as is evident by their bringing on Tremblings,
weakening the Memory, and impairing
the Understanding. To maintain
Health, the Solids are to keep up their due
Force or Spring, that they may propel the
Fluids, and prevent their breaking them
down by too great a Resistance. The Fluids
are to be kept in such a state, that they may
neither run too rapidly, nor clog by the way
for want of the circulating Power. Thus
in Rivers, where the Banks and Fences are
weak, the Pressure of the Water will break
them down; or if the Water be clogg’d and
render’d foul by any Mixture foreign to it’s
Nature, or is otherwise obstructed in it’s
Course, it cannot reach those various Meanders,
those small Canals it was allotted to
fill.</p>

<p>Hence every Eye may see how destructive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
this unnatural Habit must be to our
Frame. The Tone of the Stomach is
weaken’d, and with it, the Power of Digestion;
Obstructions of the Liver and other
Parts ensue; the Solids are broke, and the
Fluids forsake their proper Channels: hence
Jaundice, Dropsies, Palsies, and various
other Distempers, fatal in their Consequences,
and doubly acute to those who reflect,
that they have brought them on themselves:
for however thoughtless or indifferent they
may be while in Health, when bitter Remembrance
accompanies the severe Effects,
the Situation must be dreadful.</p>

<p>I have observ’d that many are innocently
led into this grievous Habit: and they are
the more liable to it, as the Goodness of
their Constitution preserves some longer than
others, from being sensible of it’s ill Effects.
But they must beware of Illusions, and convince
themselves of one Truth at least; that
instead of that Nutrition which proper Food
yields, the Blood and other Juices are by
this means vitiated; and with them that
most salutary Fluid the Milk. It is true
indeed that all Drams are not alike pernicious;
nor do they, as I have just hinted, act
alike on all Constitutions. Yet thus much is
certain; that they all contain fiery Particles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
a Portion of caustic inflammable Matter, in
general very injurious to our whole Frame;
very unfit to circulate in our Blood and
Juices; and above all, extremely prejudicial
to those Infants who imbibe the Infection
by sucking at a Breast thus unhappily
tainted.</p>

<p>But besides this dreadful Habit in the
Mother or Nurse, there is a Practice among
the Vulgar still more shocking; and which
must make every reasonable Creature shrink
with Horror; that of giving Drams to the
Children themselves, even while Infants.
Nothing is more strongly urg’d by all moral
Writers than the Force of Example;
and when they mean to paint a bad Parent,
they describe a Child imitating those Vices
his Father acts before him. But here Description
is too weak; no Language has
Force enough to express the Horror of this
Vice! These unhappy wretched Parents
forestall Imitation; they stay not ’till the
Child has Power to follow their Example;
but pour the deadly Poison down the poor
Babe’s Throat, even before it can speak!
What, I say again, what Language can describe
the Horror of this Vice? Surely none.</p>

<p>All wise Men agree, that Virtues flow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
or ought to flow, from the Head; that the
Inferior receive their Influence from the Superior;
and most act by Imitation of their
Betters: but Experience shews us, that the
Little can sometimes teach the Great Virtues
they were before Strangers to; and by
a still stranger Inversion of the natural Order
of Things, it often happens, that the Great
imitate the Vices of the Little. But here I
cannot refrain from exhorting Parents of
every Rank never to suffer themselves to fall
into so dreadful an Error as that just hinted
at. Those who are already tainted with it
are perhaps too abandon’d to be reclaim’d;
or have it not in their Power to remove the
Mischief they have caused: but those who
are happily Strangers to it, must keep their
Attention awake; must live in a constant
Resolution never to let a Child so much as
touch so dangerous a Weapon; unless they
choose to be their Childrens Murderers;
choose to have them fall a Sacrifice to some
dire Disease; or become Cripples, Idiots,
or Brutes.</p>

<p>Before I quit this Head, I must take Notice
of an inferior Degree of the same Error;
less a Vice indeed, because there is an
Intention of Good in it, tho’ generally a mistaken
one; I mean that of putting Brandy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
and other spirituous Liquors into Childrens
Victuals. How this Practice came to be
introduced is amazing! But tho’ the general
Pretence is preventing or curing Wind
and Gripes, it is highly erroneous: for
where these Disorders really exist they should
be treated in another Manner; and by People
whose Judgment can be depended on.</p>

<p>The next Degree of Error to this, is the
early Custom Parents have of giving their
Children Wine. Grown People, even among
the Temperate, often drink much more of
it than is either needful or beneficial; but
Children want it not at all. To give Wine
to Infants is a gross Error; and even to
those who have pass’d that Stage, the Practice
is very wrong.</p>

<p>Wine, tho’ a general Term for the Juice
produced from Grapes, is undoubtedly a
very different Liquor, not only in Colour
and Flavour, but in Quality, according to
the Country it grows in; as is manifest by
the different Effects of it on the Human
Body. One Sort is found to constringe too
much; another is loaded with Tartar; a
third abounds with a large Portion of inflammable
Spirit; and so on. But not to
enter into a physical Analysis of Wine, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
will say it is allow’d to assist the Digestion,
to warm the Blood, and give a certain
Sprightliness, which, in other Words, we
call a Flow of Spirits. Now in the Case of
Children we injure them if we give them
gross Food, such as requires Wine to digest;
and if Wine be added to it, we put Fuel to
Fire, Flame to Flame; nor does the Blood
and Spirits need this foreign Assistance
while young: the one is by Nature sufficiently
warm’d; and the other are best supported
by Temperance and a chearful Disposition.</p>

<p>I will not take upon me to fix precise
Rules on this Head, both because it is very
difficult, and in general they would not be
adher’d to: but thus much I seriously recommend,
that Children in the first Septenary
taste no Wine at all; in the second be
vastly sparing; and in the third fix a Temperance
built on solid Principles of Reason
and Virtue; such as will best secure to them
Health and Happiness for their whole
Lives.</p>

<p>I am here naturally led to speak of Malt
Liquor, the native Produce of our Country:
but on this, as well as the two foregoing
Heads, we must keep Temperance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
in View, from the double Motive of Health
and Virtue. Experience teaches us, that
Malt Liquor can be rais’d to any Degree of
Strength; that it is capable of inflaming the
Blood and intoxicating the Brain; consequently
it is capable of weakening and destroying
our Frame when intemperately
used. But besides these Effects, it has
others often very hurtful, but less regarded,
because less sensible. One, from a natural
Weakness of the Bowels, it throws into habitual
Purgings; another it oppresses with
Wind; and in a third, from its glutinous
Quality, it obstructs some of the Viscera,
and has a peculiar Tendency to clog the
Vessels of the Lungs, and thereby hinder
Respiration, produce Coughs, and those fatal
Circumstances frequently attending them.
Hence it is easy to see how necessary the
Parents Attention is, to guide their Children
herein. Infants, at least for the first
Year, have no Business with Malt Liquor
at all; they ought not to taste it: Milk, or
Water, or both together, is their proper
Drink; and if after this Age, these were
made the Liquor to drink with their Food,
it would be no worse for them. However,
not to be too rigorous in this respect, let
Children after the first Year, wash down
their Victuals with light clear Small-beer;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
and nothing beyond that for the first seven
Years. In the second and third Septenary,
the same Rule which has been laid down
concerning Wine, should be observ’d in all
strong Malt Liquors; they should be very
sparingly used. Nothing is more dangerous
than the Indulgence of Parents in this
Point; for besides the many ill Effects already
mentioned, ’tis coarse and vulgar; it
clouds the Understanding, and renders
young People unfit for Study. Besides
these, it gives them an early Bloatedness;
and greatly endangers the laying the Foundation
of a Sot for Life: or at least gives
them such a Hankering, as cannot but be a
great Impediment to their Happiness.</p>

<p>Nothing is more talk’d of for the Good of
Children, and yet nothing more unsettled, than
the necessary Degree of Warmth; and while
some Parents are sanguine in maintaining
the Necessity of much Cloathing, there are
others as obstinately prone to freeze their tender
Babes: even skilful and ingenious Physicians
disagree in this Particular.</p>

<p>It is a Maxim in Philosophy, that Heat
is a Principle of Life: and indeed, without
the Assistance of the Schools, every one
knows the Truth of it. All know, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
Life is warm, Death is cold; and therefore
to support Life, there must always be a Degree
of Warmth. This premised, it appears
that Warmth is natural to us; but
where to begin, or how to maintain such a
Degree of it in our Children as will keep us
from either Extreme, is not easy to determine.
However, to keep as wide of Error
as we can, we must keep close to Nature’s
Laws.</p>

<p>Nature then, I think, points out to us,
that new-born Children want more Cloaths
in Proportion than others. When we consider
how warm a Bed they have long been
wrapp’d in before their Birth; when we
consider too how tender all their Fibres must
be; and see them shivering, trembling and
cold as soon as the external Air surrounds
them; we cannot but conclude that they
are greatly cherished and comforted by the
Addition of Cloaths.</p>

<p>It is true that the same Philosophy which
teaches us that Heat is a Principle of Life,
teaches also, that Action is the Cause of
Heat: but new-born Infants being incapable
of Action to any Degree, it appears to me,
that for the Reasons already given, they
stand in need of an additional, or rather, an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
adventitious Warmth, from Cloaths, Fire,
Sun, or all, in their proper Time and
Place.</p>

<p>Should any one urge that thin Cloathing
of Children is the rational Way to make
them hardy, and inure them to Cold, I am
ready to grant it; but I cannot help being
of Opinion, that it ought not to be begun
with. In most other Things relating to
Children we succeed best by beginning at
once; but here I think we should proceed
by Degrees. Let Parents then at the Birth
give Children all the Comfort Cloaths can
afford them; and when some Months Time
has hardened their Fibres, and thereby
strengthened their Solids, let them be thinned
gradually. One sensible Distinction
may be made that should be universally regarded:
that is, the Difference of Climate
and Seasons. A Child born in the midst of
Summer, or where the Air is incapable of
affecting it very sensibly, need not to have
so much cloathing as one born in the Depth
of Winter, or in a colder Climate.</p>

<p>It is easy for my Readers to see that I am
an Advocate for Warmth; and that I do
not only recommend it as yielding great
Comfort to Infants, but esteem it highly necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
and useful to them: and should any
farther Proof be required to support this
Opinion, we may refer to all created Nature,
animate and inanimate.</p>

<p>In this View of Nature we shall find the
Birds not only provide Nests for their young,
but cover them with their Wings, to guard
them from the chilly Air, ’till Time has encreased
their Feathers. The Beasts with
amazing Tenderness, cherish their young,
’till Nature has lengthened the Hair, the
Wool, or whatever covers them; or Time
has given them the Power of Action. Farther
we shall find, that Insects, and all the
vegetable Creation, shoot out into Life, and
receive Vigor, Comfort, and Support, from
that glorious Body the Sun: so indispensably
necessary is Warmth; and so essential
to the raising and preserving of All.</p>

<p>Such of my Readers as agree with me on
this Head, must still be cautious not to over-act
their Part. This Preceps suits so well
the tender Nature of Mothers, that if heedless,
they will easily slide into Error; and I
should be wanting in the Duty of a faithful
Guide, or an honest Adviser, if I did not endeavour
to prevent it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. <i>James Douglas</i>, deservedly eminent in
his Profession, once (within my own Knowledge)
gave it as his Opinion of a Child he
attended, that it perished with Cold. The
Doctor had laid a Woman of Rank of her
first, nay her only Child, a Son too, and
Heir to a large Estate. The Season was
cold; the Child was dry-nurs’d; and a small
four-post Bed was, by the Advice of some
ignorant People, made on purpose for it to
lye in alone. In this neglected starving
Way the Child was kept ’till ready to expire,
and when too late to help it, they
sought Advice. All Means were try’d in
vain, the poor Babe sunk into the Grave:
and, as I have already observ’d, the Doctor,
upon examining every Circumstance,
pronounc’d it starv’d to Death. Here we
have an Instance of one Extreme of Error;
and I have introduc’d it as a Hint to Parents
that all Extremes are to be avoided; and
that while they shrink at the one, they must
be careful not to plunge into the other.</p>

<p>It has already been agreed, that Children
at the Birth should have all the Comfort
Cloaths can give them. I will now observe,
that it is every Way advantageous, that for
the first Year at least, they lye in a Cradle,
or in a small Crib by the Bed-side of the Parents,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
or whoever has the Care of them.
To put an Infant in a Bed by itself for several
Hours before the Bed-time of the Mother
or Nurse, is in general too cold a Situation;
and afterwards, if it is not then
too hot, which with some is a doubt, it is
attended with several Inconveniences. First,
it is pretty sure to disturb the Child; a
Matter of real Consequence: secondly, when
once disturb’d, it will very likely have no
Sleep again but lying at the Breast, a Circumstance
attended with great Trouble and
Anxiety to those who suckle it: thirdly,
there is always Danger more or less of the
Child being overlaid; which is a Consideration
that ought justly to alarm every Parent,
as many Children have by this means
been kill’d in one Night’s time. I am very
sensible how watchful a tender Mother usually
is, but there are Times that the best are
unguarded; and it is surely right for them
to put it out of their own Power to hazard
so dreadful an Accident. Nay this Danger
has been thought so great, however common
the Practice is, that the most sensible
People have spoke and wrote against it. To
obviate therefore this Evil, Parents need
only let Infants lye in a Cradle or Crib;
which will keep them in a regular equal
Warmth, secure them from all unnecessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Disturbance, and effectually prevent any
fatal Accident.</p>

<p>By what has already been advanc’d, it
appears, that tho’ due Care is recommended,
yet it is not design’d to cherish that false Delicacy
which Parents, especially Mothers, are
but too apt to keep up in their Children,
whether Boys or Girls; on the contrary I
have advis’d, that their Cloathing be thinn’d
by Degrees. Let them too be wash’d every
Day with cold Water, the Head and Limbs
at least, if not all over; and be carried out
as much as can be into the open Air.</p>

<p>To breathe in a free, open, pure Air, is
undoubtedly of great Use; by giving that
Spring to the Solids so conducive to the
establishing and preserving Health. Children
therefore, especially if born in <i>London</i>,
stand in need of this Assistance; they should
often have the Freedom of tasting a sweeter
Air, than that which usually surrounds their
Habitation. Here I am aware, that this
Advice, instead of being properly relish’d,
will be swallow’d greedily; instead of its
serving to rouse the Care of Parents, it will
endanger the banishing the Child, which
under the Pretext that Air is good, will be
sent to a Place, where perhaps every thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
else is bad. Parents, especially the Fathers,
who do not love the Noise or any other of
the Inconveniences attending the Care of
Children, have a short Way of doing Business
by sending them at once into the Country;
and to support the Reasonableness of
their Conduct, readily tell their Friends,
that those who write about these Matters recommend
Air, and say that Children thrive
best in it. But surely they have never study’d
the Duty of Parents, or they must
know, that it is always incumbent on them,
unless Necessity prevent it, to rear their
Children themselves. But to prove farther
that it is not always a Child’s Good which
they seek, so much as their own Ease, it is
often sent to be nurs’d even in <i>London</i>;
sometimes too in a part much worse than
they themselves live in; perhaps where
noxious Effluvia are continually surrounding
it; or in some narrow Lane or close Alley.</p>

<p>Where real Necessity pleads, no Arguments
can be brought against it: otherwise
I would universally recommend, that Children
be brought up under the Eye of the
Parents. Let the Methods propos’d have a
fair Tryal; if those are ineffectual, and the
Child does not thrive, by all means remove
it into the Country; but still, if practicable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
accompany’d with the Mother, and under
her Care; if that cannot be comply’d with,
send it to a Nurse. Still I have one Objection
that has great Weight with me, whatever
it may have with my Readers. The common
Country People (such as we may suppose
take Children to nurse) tho’ usually very innocent,
have nevertheless that Innocence intermixt
with a large Portion of Obstinacy;
in short, they will always do their own
Way. Now it is well known that almost
the only Flesh Meat these People eat the
Year thro’, is Bacon and Pork; with this
Meat, which of all others is the worst in the
World for Children, the Nurses cram them
unmercifully. To tell them that they give
Children Meat too young, avails nothing;
to urge that it is a gross kind of Food, capable
of creating bad Humours in the
Blood, and thereby accumulating Disorders,
which like a smother’d Fire, will some time
or other burst out with Violence, is like encountering
the Winds; Don’t you see, they
cry, how fat and jolly the little Rogue is?
They are not aware, that to be fat is one
thing, and to be healthy another: for bad
Fat may be compared to ill-gotten Wealth,
they both prey upon the Vitals. Thus then
while I maintain the Advantages arising
from Childrens Breathing in a pure Air, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
cannot help condemning the Practice of exposing
them to many other Dangers.</p>

<p>Besides the Food, Warmth and Air, necessary
for preserving the Health of Children,
there is another Mean of great Importance,
but much neglected, to the Detriment
of many; viz. Exercise. When some
Months Time, as I observed before, has
strengthened their Solids, they are then fitted
for Action; without which there is but
little chance for Health: the Laws of Nature
demand it; and it is almost incredible,
the Mischief that attends the want of it.
Exercise affords the most natural and the
most comfortable Warmth to our whole
Frame that can be. Exercise makes the
Blood and other Juices circulate with Freedom;
prevents the Mischief too often arising
from Stagnation, and throws off the redundant
Matter through the Pores of the
Skin by insensible Perspiration. And Exercise
too, greatly contributes to that Flow of
Spirits, that lively pleasing Air and chearful
Countenance so essential to our Happiness.</p>

<p>The first half Year of a Child’s Life is
far the least troublesome to a Mother or
Nurse; for after that time Children begin to
take Notice, shew they love Action, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
where they are well nursed, never are so
happy as when they are exercised; and indeed
it is scarcely possible to give them too
much of it. There should be no Sluggards
about a Child, no body that wants either
Will or Power to toss it about continually;
and from six Months, to a Year and half, or
two Years old, it is really a great Fatigue to
give it due Attendance. But Parents must
remember it is an indispensable Duty; and
their faithful Discharge of it will, generally
speaking, be amply rewarded by a more
solid Health in their Children than can be
expected without it; and by having their
future Trouble greatly lessened: for how
often does it happen that Children for want
of due Exercise grow ricketty, become
Cripples, or are puny all their Childhood,
perhaps their whole Lives; to their own
great Sorrow, and to the inexpressible Trouble,
Pain, and Expence of the Parents.</p>

<p>Rickets is a Distemper extremely common
in <i>London</i>; but if the Rules already laid
down be observed, I dare affirm, it will
very rarely be seen. It is not indeed the
Design of this Treatise to cure Diseases, but
to prevent them; yet as thousands of Children
fall into the Rickets in a manner insensibly,
often without it’s being once apprehended;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
I would here not only keep the
Attention of Parents awake, but propose a
Remedy.</p>

<p>Let us then observe, that many Children
have all the appearance imaginable of Health,
Strength, and Vigor, till about nine Months
old; after that Age they begin to dwindle,
grow listless, heavy and inactive, which to
account for, Parents find a thousand Causes,
perhaps all wide of the real. One ascribes it
to cutting the Teeth, another to a Fever, a
third to loss of Appetite, and so on; when
after a Time it proves the Rickets: the Cause
whereof is, generally speaking, bad Nursing.
But whether this, or any other Weakness
produces the Distemper, I earnestly recommend,
that it be not suffered to pass unregarded,
since much depends upon our early
Care.</p>

<p>The great and noble Remedy for this Disorder
is a Cold Bath; and tho’ the Tenderness
of Mothers may make them shrink at the
Proposal, yet neither their own Weakness,
nor the Child’s Reluctance, must in this Case
prevail, especially when I assure them that a
very short Time will make the use of it not
only easy but pleasant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>If a Child along with this Disorder has a
Fever, a full quick Pulse and short Breath (as
is very common) Parents should certainly ask
proper Advice before they begin to use the
Bath. But as some may be careless in this
Matter, or at least unwilling to submit; and
as many ill Consequences may follow from
setting out wrong, I will in that Case recommend,
that two or three Ounces of Blood be
taken away at the Arm or Neck; next Day
purge it with Rhubarb, and repeat it to
three or four times, at a Day or two’s distance
between each Dose: and even where there is
no Fever, and the Lungs play freely, it should
still be purged as above directed.</p>

<p>The more Water and the colder the Bath
the better. At first use it only two or three
times a Week, afterwards every Day; and
continue it (unless other Accidents intervene)
’till every appearance of Weakness be vanished,
even though it should last long, or
come on in the coldest Season.</p>

<p>To obviate as much as possible all groundless
Fears, I will on this Head add, that as
Cold Baths act very powerfully on the whole
Frame, they are frequently observed to give
Cold at first using; and sometimes affect the
Limbs and other Parts very sensibly; all
which goes off on repeating it. And indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
where a Cold Bath is judged proper, the only
Circumstance which justifies the Disuse of
it, is, it’s leaving a Shivering and Coldness
all over, instead of that pleasing comfortable
Glow, which generally follows the use of it.</p>

<p>The proper Cloathing of Children is a Consideration
of great Importance; and indeed
the Opinions of different Men in the Learned
World, and of different Women in the Conversable
World, are so very many, as to render
it next to impossible to fix a Standard for
Dress with regard to Health only, that would
in any manner square with the various Notions
subsisting. Arguing on Principles of
Philosophy, from Reasons founded on the
Knowledge of Anatomy, and the Animal
Oeconomy, will not go down with the
Croud. Nor will Examples produced from
Practice, prevail on the Learned to think
the general Practice right. It is not enough
to say, that different Nations act with more
or less Propriety on this Head; for even our
own Country is herein much divided in itself.</p>

<p>What I have before observed on cloathing
Children, relates only to the keeping up a
due Degree of Warmth, ’till Time strengthens
their Solids; but the grand Controversy is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
what kind of Cloaths they should wear, and
how they must be put on; how Boys should
be cloathed, and how Girls; what Cloathing
conduces to Health, and what impairs it:
with many other Things much disputed, but
still unsettled.</p>

<p>Nothing is more certain than that Nature in
general is our best, our surest Guide, for the
Conduct of Life; yet if we make the Law
universal, we shall undoubtedly sometimes
err. Two things all Mankind inherit in consequence
of our first Parents Disobedience,
viz. the Turbulence of our Passions, and our
bodily Defects and Infirmities: all are sensible
of this; all see and feel them, more or
less. How small is the number of those, whose
Passions are by Nature so happily calm, as to
keep them free from Irregularities! How few
are those, to whom Nature has given a perfect
Form: whose Stature, Limbs, and Features,
bear exact Proportion and Symmetry, free from
Blemishes and Defects; such as constitutes a
finish’d Beauty: or whose Constitution is so
happily temper’d as to have no Bias, no weak
Side, no redundant Humours to disturb Life
and Health. This I say is evidently the Lot
of very few. Still Providence, ever kind, has
furnished us with Means to turn all things to
our Advantage. To regulate our Passions we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
are endowed with Reason; to rectify, as far as
Nature will permit, our bodily Defects, we are
supplied with Judgment: but as in the first
Case we are apt to let Passion get the
Mastery of Reason; so in the other, we often
let our Judgment err, or suffer Fancy to take
place of it. Hence arise many of those Mistakes
Mankind daily run into; and hence
too the Judgment of one will sometimes be
perverted into Fancy, and the Fancy of another
be falsly esteemed Judgment. From this
view it is easy to see, how vast a Field is open
to Mankind to exercise their Judgment in;
but where that is weak, Errors will certainly
make their Way; which from the Propensity
we have to do wrong, are sometimes so
prevailing and swift, as to become almost
universal; even so far as utterly to overturn
superior Judgment. Now though we grant
that every one is possessed not only of a
Power, but of a Right of judging; yet we
do not agree, that the Judgment of the
Weak, or of those who have neglected to
exercise and improve their natural Faculties,
should be abided by, and made our Rule of
Conduct: for as our Law-givers should be
wise, and as from them we seek to be secured
in our Property and our Peace; so
from those who have searched into Nature,
who have studied the Animal Oeconomy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
and are acquainted with the Structure of our
Frame, from those only can we rationally
learn how to preserve Health. To apply then
these Arguments to the Matter in hand, I
would recommend to Parents with regard to
Cloathing their Children, to be attentive
themselves; to exercise and improve their
own Judgment, as far as they have opportunity;
not suddenly to run with the Croud,
lest it prove a vulgar Error; but endeavour
to learn what is the Opinion of Judges: and
by comparing that with the general Practice,
they may draw such Conclusions as will profit
them most.</p>

<p>Dress, in the common Acceptation of the
Word, is not my Province; those People
whose Business it is to promote it, know that
the World is fickle and inconstant; they
know that Men will change, even though it
be for the worse, purely from a Love of
Novelty: therefore is it that at one Time a
Man has his Hips almost up to his Arm-pits,
another Time he must stoop to get his Hand
into his Coat Pocket; therefore is it that one
Year a Woman is (at the Will of the Stay-maker)
to be short-waisted, another Year
long-waisted; with many more Absurdities,
that ought at least to be laughed at. But
where Dress is capable of affecting our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
Health, it both deserves and demands Attention
and Regard: And to that End, I
will for the Instruction of my Readers, give
the Sentiments of the Learned on this
Head.</p>

<p>It is the Opinion of many, that every kind
of Bandage is an Error in Practice; even
Garters, Wrist-bands, and Collars; that they
impede the Circulation of the Blood, or at
least render it unequal and irregular, and prevent
the proper Growth of the Solids; nay
more, that they are a frequent though latent
Cause of Apoplexies, and other dreadful Diseases.
It is farther their Opinion, that whatever
compresses the Frame, (particularly the
tender one of a Child) is dangerous; as Rollers,
stiff Stays, and the like: that as the
Trunk of the Body contains, what Physicians
call the <i>Viscera</i>, in which are the chief Functions
of Life, whatever external Methods
are used to bind or cramp them up, is prejudicial
to Health. That the Lungs particularly
are to have free room to play; and that
if the Chest be externally press’d, whether by
Rollers, Stays, Waistcoats, or any thing else,
it lays the Foundation of many future Evils.
To these general Opinions, let me add that
of an eminent Writer. Mr. <i>Locke</i>, in his
Treatise of Education, says, “Narrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
Breasts, short and stinking Breath, ill
Lungs and Crookedness, are the natural and
almost constant Effects of <i>hard Bodice</i> and
<i>Cloaths</i> that pinch. That way of making
slender Waists and fine Shapes, serves but
the more effectually to spoil them. Nor
can there indeed but be Disproportion in
the Parts, when the Nourishment prepar’d
in the several Offices of the Body,
cannot be distributed as Nature designs.
And therefore what wonder is it, if being
laid where it can on some Part not so
braced, it often makes a Shoulder or Hip
higher or bigger than it’s just Proportion.”
He then produces the Example of the <i>Chinese</i>
Women, who of all People on Earth, have
the smallest Feet, not naturally, but made
so by cramping them; from a notion that it
is beautiful; by which Practice, says he, it
is believed they impede their Growth and
shorten their Lives. Now to confirm and
strengthen what is here advanced, we must
observe, that besides the universal Reputation
Mr. <i>Locke</i> so justly obtain’d as a Man of Science,
he was design’d for a Physician: and
though he never practised Physic, he had
studied it. To these Opinions may be added
the general Consent of Mankind, that in
those Countries where Stays are not worn at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
all, the People are seldom or never known
to be crooked.</p>

<p>Now let us examine the general Practice,
and the Motives which influence it; that no
Injustice may be done in a Treatise that aims
at the general Good of Mankind. Mothers
and Nurses observe, that a new-born Child has
no Support of itself; the Head leans on one
side or the other; and the Body sinks as it
were into a Heap: to remedy which, and
to prop up the helpless Babe, they put what
is call’d a Stay to its Neck, they roll a Flannel
many times round its Body, and at the
Expiration of a Month it is usually coated:
that is, it continues when undress’d with the
Roller; and in the Day Time when dress’d,
it wears a Stay about the Waist. The Stay
to the Neck is left off in some Months, and
the Roller in about a Year; some sooner,
some later: but the same Method is used
both to Boys and Girls. The first, second
and third Stays are usually very soft and plyable;
but after that, when a Child approaches
to two Years old, they are then made stronger,
that is, stiffer to the Feel; and these
Sort are worn by Boys ’till they are breech’d,
and by Girls their whole Lives. Nurses urge,
that Children are helpless, cannot sit upright,
nor be toss’d about without them. And I remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
an eminent Surgeon, late of one of
our Hospitals, once told me, that a Child was
brought to him with several of its Ribs crush’d
inward by the Hand of the Person who had
been tossing it about without its Stays.</p>

<p>But as I have just observed, it is not in Infancy
only that Stays are used; but in one
Sex, ’till four, five, or six, Years old; and
in the other for Life. The Solicitude of
Parents about Shape, is chiefly confin’d to
the Girls; Boys, when breech’d, like Eels,
twist themselves into a thousand Forms, and
prove strait at last; while the Girls, with less
Freedom and more Anxiety, seldom come
off so well. Still Mothers contend for the
Necessity of Stays; and maintain from Experience,
that the Shape, instead of being
hurt with them, is spoil’d without them.
Here then is the grand Point, whether Nature
requires these Props or not; the Learned
say they don’t; general Practice says they
do: the Learned recommend that Nature be
left to Fashion the Parts herself; but general
Practice contradicts this: and who will
take upon them to decide so important a
Matter? for me, I confess it is too much.</p>

<p>When I read or hear the Opinion of skilful
Men, and weigh their Reasoning, I heartily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
concur with them; and when I see an exquisite
Shape under a judicious Mother’s Management,
I am inclin’d to applaud her Judgment,
and commend the Choice of her Stay-maker.
However, that I might not leave this
Head and determine nothing, I have already
recommended to Parents to exercise their own
Judgment, and to seek that of others; whereby
many of the Errors, become general thro’
Ignorance and Time, will be removed. The
Learned, unless dogmatical, will be brought
to allow, that Stays may often be worn without
the least Injury; that as Girls are by Nature
more tender and delicate than Boys, many
of them would have been deformed either
thro’ bad nursing, or some inbred Infirmity,
tho’ they never had worn a Stay in their
Lives: and Parents will be convinc’d, that
while Nature is labouring to compleat their
Children’s Growth, both Health and Beauty
greatly depend on their not being braced injudiciously.</p>

<p>As I am speaking of Health and Beauty,
it will not be improper to observe, that with
regard to the outward Form, what is most
agreeable to see, is often most conducive to
Health and Strength. Thus the Dancing-master
has Power to confer many Advantages
on his Scholars. That Command and free<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
Play of the Joints of the Knees, with the
Habit of keeping them unbent but when necessary,
and the proper turning out of the
Toes, add great Firmness and Grace both to
standing and walking: that graceful Power
of the Arms, the easy Fall, and the dropping
of the Shoulders from the Neck, gives
a pleasing Distinction of the bred from the
unbred: and the keeping the Body upright,
and throwing forward the Chest, are besides
being great Beauties, vastly conducive to the
free Exercise of the Lungs, and to the proper
Action of the whole <i>Viscera</i>.</p>

<p>But while this Part of Education is justly
commended as conducive to Health, and
pleasing to behold, what shall we say of those,
who under the Appearance of increasing their
Beauty destroy it; and who, while aiming at
Health, often deprive themselves of Life. I
have shewn that bodily Defects are more or
less the Lot of all Mankind; but where Judgment
free from Error can rectify them, we
have Power to do it. If we can find a Cure
for Diseases born with us, we certainly may
and ought; if we can increase our Strength,
and add Graces to Nature, we undoubtedly
should; we may curl our Hair, increase its
Growth, or cut it off; we may and ought to
comb or shave our Head, pare our Nails,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
and scour off all that Foulness which Nature
throws out upon the Surface of our Body,
and maintain a constant Cleanliness: But all
this does not imply that we may give ourselves
a new Face; and yet little less is frequently
attempted. When Nature is oppressed
within us, she often, for our Relief,
throws out the Malady upon the Skin; if it
happen to be on the Face, we grow restless
and impatient; we are ignorant of the Kindness
done to us; and to remove the Blemish
to our Beauty, we unadvisedly drive back the
redundant Humour; perhaps on our Vitals;
and thus fall a Sacrifice to our Pride or Ignorance.</p>

<p>There is a Practice, particularly among the
Great, shocking to Nature and to Reflection;
that of using Paint. Paint is to the Face,
what Affectation is to the Mind: as the one
is a ridiculous Mimic of amiable Qualities we
are Strangers to, so the other is a ridiculous
Affectation of Beauty we cannot reach. But
while Paint disappoints those who are attach’d
to it, by conferring false Beauty, it is attended
with the Mischief of impairing real; and
many who by Nature alone would be comely
in the Decline of Life, are, by this odious
Practice, hagged even in Youth. Temperance,
Exercise, good Hours, and a chearful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
Mind, will best preserve the Bloom of
Life; but such is the present Age, such the
prevailing false Taste, that Error is confounded
with Error, and our corrupt Judgment is
still farther corrupted. There was a Time
that Paint was designed to give a false Bloom
when the real was declining; but now it is
used to hide even the natural Bloom: it is
made an Instrument to destroy that Beauty
which Providence has bestowed; and instead
of being grateful for the Blessing, it is shamefully
hid under a pale Enamel, or a dead
White! What an Indignity, what an Affront
is this to the Author of all Nature, to the
Bestower of all Blessings!</p>

<p>Lord <i>Hallifax</i>, in his Advice to a Daughter,
goes so far as to dissuade her even from
the Use of Sweets. “Those Ladies (says he)
who perfume themselves, will be strongly
suspected of doing it to conceal some other
Stink.” Cleanliness is to be preferred to
every foreign Aid; for tho’ it is certain, that
Nature throws off some offensive Matter,
whether perceptible or not, by the several
Organs given for those Purposes, yet daily
washing the Mouth, combing the Head, and
using every other Means of Cleanliness, bids
much fairer for rendering us inoffensive to
others, than the general and immoderate Use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
of Perfumes. And therefore I cannot but
concur with this noble Writer, in dissuading
Parents from introducing among their Children
the Custom of seeking foreign Assistance
in order to be sweet. Should I add to
this, that continually striking on those Nerves
which convey the Sense of Smelling to us,
is prejudicial to our Health, I should advance
no more than what many learned Men
hold as a Truth.</p>

<p>But there is another Pretext for using
Sweets, which must not pass unobserved;
that of keeping us from being sensible of the
various Smells around us. It is true that those
are sometimes so grossly offensive, as to justify,
and even demand, our shutting them out:
but in general, there is too much false Delicacy,
too strong a Tincture of Pride, and too
little Sense of our own Infirmities in this Practice.
On these last Heads then I must beg
Leave to admonish Parents, even of the highest
Rank (should this little Work ever fall
into their Hands) to be greatly circumspect
with regard to their Children; that they be
careful to give them a due Sense of the Blessings
Nature has bestowed on them; that
they point out to them the most rational
Way of correcting natural Defects; and
above all, to imprint on them a just Detestation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
of every Practice which has a Tendency
to raise their Vanity, and add Fuel to their
Pride. To this end, Parents should convince
their Children, that the fashionable Cosmetics
greatly endanger Health; Paint debases
both the Face and the Mind; the wanton
Use of Perfumes is an Error in Principle,
and all are fraught with mischievous Effects.</p>

<p>It may be urged, that Children are not subject
to the Use of these things, at least while
Children: I grant it. But my Readers must
observe, that when I enter on a Topic, I
am naturally led thro’ it; and as we never
stand still in Life, so Parents must bring
their Ideas forward, and consider their Children
as always advancing. Nay I may without
Impropriety say farther, that Vanity is
one of the first things that Children learn;
and it demands the early Attention of Parents
to keep it under, by discountenancing
the Practice of every thing which tends to
support or cherish it.</p>

<p>Parents are naturally anxious to have this
first Entrance on the Stage of Life got thro’
with Success; and I flatter myself, that the
Rules already laid down will conquer, or at
least lessen the Difficulty attending it. How
eager are all good Parents to see their Children
weaned; to have them firm on their
Feet; to find their Mouths full of Teeth;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
and to hear them prattle: nay there are
many, particularly Fathers, who think their
Children of no Importance, at least they have
no Pleasure in them, ’till these are effected.
That nothing therefore may obstruct this
Progress, I will here add a Word or two
more.</p>

<p>It is a Point much disputed, whether a
young Child is better or worse for wearing
Shoes and Stockings; for my own Part, I
think they are both: but, as this may seem
a Paradox, I will explain myself. The Disuse
of Shoes and Stockings is to make Children
hardy; but my Readers will remember,
that unless Regard be had to Time and Season,
they may cramp their tender Limbs,
and do them great Harm. Stockings therefore
cannot with Prudence be totally neglected,
lest it prove a Neglect to the Child; and
Shoes, when they are put on it’s Feet, are,
besides being not so disagreeable to see, much
safer to walk about in; as nobody can answer
that Pins, Splinters, Stones, and various
other things will not sometimes fall in
their Way, even on the smoothest Floor, or
a Carpet. Thus much in their Favour: but
what I have to say against them is not less
significant. According to the usual Method
of managing Children, they wear no Cloth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
in the Day-time after five or six Months old;
and then, if they are not carefully watched,
they will frequently wet themselves, and
thereby make Shoes and Stockings an Impediment
to their thriving, by soaking them, as
it were, in Wet, Cold, and Nastiness. Either
then let a Child be kept clean with them, or
intirely go without them; for of two Evils,
it is always most eligible to chuse the least.</p>

<p>But a little Judgment and Attention would
obviate this Inconvenience; for as even Infants
are not without various Ways of shewing
their Wants, an Attention to these, and
a Method of putting them regularly into
their Chair, would be very convenient both
to Mother and Child: and if notwithstanding
this, it should by chance wet itself, having
dry Shoes and Stockings always ready to
put on, would prevent any ill Effect.</p>

<p>I am of Opinion, that Parents are often
too eager to have their Children walk; by
which, they take such Means as serve to retard
it. Two things much in use manifestly
keep Children back, viz. much sitting,
especially with their Cloaths up, and much
standing. They should never sit long in
their Chair, nor be left to support the
Weight of their Bodies, while their Joints<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
and Limbs are tender. Let them by all
means feel that they have Feet, but let them
not be left alone, ’till Time, Air, and Exercise
have strengthened their Solids, and
given them a lasting Firmness.</p>

<p>But we will now suppose that these first
Difficulties are all surmounted. Parents have
still many things to do, which require indeed
Attention, but neither need, nor ought to be
accompanied with any considerable Degree
of Difficulty or Pain.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding a Child is advancing, I
still recommend, that Milk and Water with
Bread, or Milk-porridge, or Rice-milk, be
it’s constant Breakfast. Parents may sometimes
alter their Course, may easily contrive
little Changes in a Child’s Diet, that will
be very pleasing, without either seeming to
humour it, or varying it so sensibly, as to
hurt the Quality. For Example, in Summer,
pour warm Water on Milk to take off
its Rawness, and let the Child with a Piece
of Bread bite and sup: in Winter let it have
Milk-porridge, or Rice-milk. Milk is accounted
to lose of its natural Sweetness by
boiling; therefore in general it should be
avoided.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>But there is another Principle Parents are
to act by, viz. a Child’s Habit of Body.
Nothing is more certain than that our Food
may be made our Physic; and if our Judgment
went Hand in Hand with Nature, we
should happily escape many bodily Infirmities,
many grievous Evils: for it would
then be easy to see when she is regular, when
not; whether she wants a Curb or a Spur;
whether she is robust or delicate; or, in
fine, whether she has any Bias, and where.
To familiarize this, let me observe, that
where a Child is hot, dry, and costive, Parents
should sometimes desist from the Use
of Milk, and give it Water-gruel, either
with or without Currants; or very small
Broth, or Milk-porridge, which last is rendered
opening by the Oat-meal. So likewise,
where the Bowels are weak, and there is an
habitual purging, the Child should be kept
more closely to Milk; have Rice-milk,
Rice-gruel, or Broth thickened with Rice;
or thick Milk, or hasty Pudding made with
Milk and Flour. Of one or other of these
things, as Occasion serves, a Child may
properly breakfast as long as the Guidance
of Parents will be necessary: and when it is
no longer a Child, but comes to act for itself,
it will not be easy to find more wholesome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
Food. Tea, Coffee, and Chocolate
are the most usual Breakfasts in lieu of these.
Tea has been spoken of already. Coffee is
hot and dry; it is rather fit for a Medicine
than a Meal, and should be used with Judgment;
it is manifestly a Cephalic, and sometimes
removes a Head-ach instantaneously
as if it were by Magic; but intemperately
used, it is very apt to sink the Spirits, and
bring on Tremblings. Chocolate has a nutritious,
balsamic Quality, yet it disagrees
with many People; it does not sit easy on
every Stomach; either from the natural Property
of the Nuts, or from its being made
too thick, and sometimes drank with Milk,
which renders it still heavier. But, generally
speaking, Tea is the Breakfast for
Children, which is often made worse, by
being accompanied with hot Bread. I have
seen a Mother so cruelly kind, for so with
Truth we may call it, as to give a young
Child all the Crum of a hot Roll for its
Breakfast; and this repeated every Day, till
it had lost not only it’s Appetite, but almost
it’s Breath.</p>

<p>There is nothing Parents should more
promote in their Children than the Love of
Bread; they should be taught to eat a great
deal of it with their Meat; be taught to eat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
it sometimes alone; but not be suffered to
eat it quite new: for the Custom of cramming
Children with hot Bread, is one of
the Ways that make them unhealthy, without
Parents being aware of it.</p>

<p>Butter is allowed to yield great Nourishment,
but there are Objections which Parents
must not disregard. It often rises in
the Stomach, is apt to give that Pain which
People call the Heart-burn, and is judged
to be frequently the Occasion of Childrens
breaking out, by obstructing some of the
Glands. Butter therefore should be eat much
more sparingly than usual, and great Care
should be taken that it is never rancid.</p>

<p>Cheese is a kind of Food which Children
are naturally very fond of; and, if left to
themselves, will eat it to an immoderate Degree.
I have observed before, that little
Changes in a Child’s Diet are at times very
right; particularly to prevent any Dislike to
certain things, either from Disuse or Affectation;
but when Cheese comes in turn to be
the Meal, it should be under great Restraint.
Suppose, for Example, a Child’s Supper is
to be Bread and Cheese, the Bread should
most certainly be considered as the Meal; a
very small Quantity of Cheese to give it a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
Relish, and convey it down, is all it ought
to have. Cheese, tho’ nutritious, should
never be eat in large Quantity; it gives
Children a restless painful Fondness for what
is relishing, and takes off their Appetite
from more wholesome simple Diet; it is
found to disagree with many Stomachs;
toasted, it is particularly bad, and difficult
to digest; and it has often a Pungency,
which creates Heat, Thirst, and Costiveness.</p>

<p>Flesh Meat has already been touched upon;
I will here add, that besides the Parents
Care that Children do not begin too
soon with it, nor eat it intemperately, they
must pay a due Regard not only to the
Quality of the Meat they give them, but to
the Time and Manner of eating it.</p>

<p>Physicians are of Opinion, that Animal-food
is not in Perfection ’till full grown;
for, like unripe Fruit, their Juices are crude,
and always more or less improper to mix
with our Blood, ’till they are in a State of
Maturity: hence it appears, that Beef and
Mutton are more wholesome than Veal and
Lamb. Nor should Beef, as the Fibres of it
are very strong, be eat too freely by those
whose Digestion is weak; and when rendered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
harder by lying long in Brine, it is still
more improper. Pork, tho’ a favourite
kind of Food, is in several Respects improper
to be eat frequently; it is extremely
apt to offend the Stomach; it has a remarkable
Tendency to bring on Purgings; and
it is suspected not to form so pure a Chyle,
and to be more disposed to load the Blood
with those Particles which create scorbutic
Disorders than any other Meat. Upon the
whole, no Meat is so universally suited to
our Nature as Mutton. For after all our
Labour and Expence to obtain greater Rarities,
after we have fatigued ourselves with
Sport, hunted down defenceless Creatures,
brought to the Ground the most wary Birds,
and cloyed ourselves with the choicest Viands,
we find perhaps a truer Relish, and a
better Appetite for a Mutton-chop. So
Topers, after spending the Night in search
of the richest Wine, after rioting in Excess,
and wearying the Tavern-waiters to please
their Palates, seek Comfort and Refreshment
in a Glass of Water.</p>

<p>Fish is a sort of Diet extremely improper
for Children. I would recommend to Parents
never to let a Child so much as taste it
for the first seven Years at least. If it were
nothing more than the Danger of Bones<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
sticking in it’s Throat, it is enough to alarm
prudent People; but most kinds of Fish are
naturally flabby, cold, and watry; are very
unfit for young Stomachs, and usually made
more so, by being accompanied with rich
Sauce.</p>

<p>Children should not be debarred Fruit;
but the Use of it requires some Attention;
1st, It should always be good in its Kind,
and ripe. 2dly, Regard is to be had what
Sort agrees, and what disagrees. 3dly,
Some Limitation as to Quantity. It is a
disputed Point whether we may eat Fruit in
a Morning; other Nations do frequently,
we seldom. In <i>France</i>, <i>Germany</i>, <i>Switzerland</i>,
and many other Places, the People always eat
Bread with their Fruit; and it appears so rational
that I believe it were better that we did
too. Fruit gives some a Pain at the Stomach,
others not; Apples, Currants, and those
Kinds, which, tho’ ripe, have still a Degree
of grateful Acidity in them, usually agree
best. Pears and Plumbs, especially the <i>Orleans</i>
Plumb, have a Tendency to bring on
Purgings, which sometimes terminate in a
Bloody Flux and Death; and therefore
should be given to Children with great Caution:
but, in fine, Experience here, as in
many other things, is to be our Guide. One
general Rule I would recommend, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
is, that the Skin or Rind of all Fruit that is
in any manner tough, be not eat. It is the
Pulp and juicy Part of the Fruit which refreshes
us; and Nature, to preserve these,
has wrapped them up in a tough kind of
Coat, which is judged by many to be very
unfit to take into the Stomach. I must not
omit to speak of Nuts. I observed before,
that merely from the Danger of Bones Children
should be kept from Fish; so, had
Nuts no other Effect than loosening the
Teeth by frequent cracking them, which
they do manifestly, they should never be
meddled with; but in Fact they have. I have
seen People eat Walnuts ’till they could
scarcely breathe; the famous <i>Barcelona</i> Nuts,
besides the Substance or fibrous Part of
them, often abound with a rank kind of
Oil; and even our own Hazel Nuts and
Filberds, when eaten in any Quantity, are
apt to create Thirst, cord up, as it were,
the whole Chest, and produce Coughs.</p>

<p>Self-gratification on one hand, and Self-interest
on the other, have introduced several
Trades the World in general might dispense
with; two of which demand my Observation,
viz. the Confectioner and the
Pastry-cook. That these Trades have their
Use I do not deny. A Nobleman, according
to the Rules of Politeness, cannot make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
an Entertainment without a Desert; thus
the Confectioner becomes necessary: in inferior
Life, the Coarseness of the Entertainment
is taken off by the Assistance of the
Pastry-cook: all which may be reasonable,
if reasonably used. But when I consider the
general Misapplication of these luscious
Dainties to Children, I cannot but condemn
it.</p>

<p>If a Child is sent to visit a Relation or
Friend, the grand Compliment is, to apply
to the Confectioner or the Pastry-cook;
and ’till the little Visitor be crammed with
Biskets, or Cakes, or Tarts, or Sweetmeats,
or all in their Turn, and that even to a Surfeit,
the welcome is not thought compleat.
Still there is some Excuse to palliate this
Mistake; the Child is considered as a Visitor;
and these Excesses are the mistaken Effects
of Good-Nature and Respect; both
which are apt grievously to err against Judgment.
But my Principals here are the Parents;
for from them alone must come the
Habit of doing right, and by them alone
must the Error be prevented or corrected.</p>

<p>I have no Objection to a Child’s having a
Tart or Bisket by Chance, but I am a profess’d
Enemy to the daily Abuses committed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
with them. If we view the Loads of
Wigs, Tarts, and Cakes, every Day made
at the Pastry-cooks, we must be astonished
at their Consumption. The Truth is, People
give these Things to their Children ’till
they have made them sick, and then give
them because they are sick. If a Person
happens to call on a Friend where there is a
Child indisposed, it is ten to one but they
find a Tart in it’s Hands; Ah! poor thing,
says Mamma, it has eat nothing to-day, so
I sent for a Tart for it. That the Hands,
the Face, the Apparel and Bedding of Children,
imprudently indulg’d with this kind
of Food, be constantly daub’d and besmear’d,
is the least bad Consequence attending
such Indiscretion; it has several other
Effects, particularly on their Health; by
vitiating their Appetites, engendering Crudities,
and alienating them from more
wholesome Diet.</p>

<p>But let us go lower into Common Life;
and view the various Outlets from <i>London</i>.
What Swarms, what Multitudes of Children
are there not in the Fields on every fine
Sunday! And what is their Entertainment?
Why, generally speaking, they are stuffed
with a coarse kind of Pastry-ware made
coarse on purpose for Children, who of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
the human Species ought not to touch it:
then to compleat the Mischief, they are to
wash it down with a foul, nauseous, heady
kind of Ale, or other Malt Liquor. Yet
when one opposes this Practice, as every
one must with Hand and Heart, who has
but a Head to guide them; Poor Things!
cry the mistaken Parents, what! take Children
into the Fields, and not give them a
Bun! But how grievously does their dotard
Fondness mislead them! Good Bread, with
a very little Sweet Butter, wash’d down with
Water, or clear well-brew’d Small Beer,
would preserve their Health; while the only
use of this Trash, is to impair or destroy
it.</p>

<p>To reduce to Method what has been here
said concerning Diet, I must observe, that
next to the proper kind of Food, nothing is
more conducive to Health than a Habit of
eating Meals regularly. Children accustomed
to eat all Day long are seldom healthy;
besides, that it makes them disorderly, and
often throws a Family into Confusion to
gratify all their little Humours. The proper
Breakfast has been already pointed
out; their Dinner should be made of one
Dish, only, unless by great Chance a passing
Taste of a second; they should either eat a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
great deal of Bread, or blend their Meat with
Greens, Turnips, or other Garden Stuff;
Pickles and all high Sauces should not be
touch’d by them; and their Meal should be
washed down with Water or light Small
Beer. Their Supper may, like their Breakfast,
sometimes be vary’d, as to the Auxiliary;
Bread is to be the Repast; yet a
small Portion of Butter, Cheese, Fruit, or
Tart, may in their Turn accompany it:
the Vehicle the same as at Dinner. But
should a Child at intermediate Times, especially
before Dinner, complain of Hunger,
and fasting long might make it’s Stomach
ach; in that Case nothing so good as a bit
of Bread; and if used to it, it will eat it as
eagerly as the greatest Dainty; but to see
Children walk about a House with Tarts or
Bread and Butter in their Hands, daubing
every thing and every body they touch, is
certainly wrong; being not only detrimental
to their Health, but to their Manners too,
as it is inexpressibly vulgar.</p>

<p>The Ideas of Parents may perhaps confine
these Rules to the first Septenary of a
Child’s Life; but I must here observe, that
no essential Difference, no very material
Changes can be made from this, even in the
second and third Stages, without some Degree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
of Error. Eating and Drinking are
made too much the Business and the Pleasure
of Life, to be consistent with either our
Health or our Reason: Parents therefore
who aim at acting on right Principles, must
for the sake of these, teach their Children to
be regular and temperate in the use of those.
It is right that they begin early, that they
set out well; but it is doubly so, that they
keep them in the same Road; and as their
Childrens Reason gathers Strength, convince
them that they must never quit it, if
they wish to live a long or happy Life: and
that, of all human Gratifications, an inordinate
Attachment to Eating and Drinking is
the meanest, and most unworthy a Man.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Locke</i> proposes, as a great Means of
preserving Health, that Boys (for it is for
them only that he writes) have Holes made
in their Shoes on purpose to let in the Wet;
which (says he) being rendered familiar to
them, will prevent their catching Cold. It
is certain this Gentleman acts here upon a
right Principle; but whether the Practice
be altogether eligible, is a Doubt. Nothing
is so hurtful to the Head, the Eyes, and the
Breast, as catching Cold in the Feet; and
therefore I cannot but concur with this ingenious
Writer, in recommending the Use of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
cold Water in order to make Children hardy.
I have before advised, that young Children
have their Limbs washed daily with cold
Water; now as many things may be rendered
familiar and easy by Custom, if, as
they advance, their Feet were daily immersed
in cold Water too, it would undoubtedly
be of vast Service, and greatly tend to confirm
their Health. But if this be never
practised, or the Practice set aside, which is
nearly the same thing, it demands double
Care of the Parents to prevent their being
liable to Colds.</p>

<p>To this End, Children’s Feet should be
washed in Water a little warm’d; for it is
extremely dangerous to make a sudden Derivation
of the Blood up to the Lungs or
Head, which is the natural Effect of cold
Water. And it is for this Reason that People
are never suffered to walk into a cold
Bath, but are thrown forwards, that the Immersion
may be total at the same instant.
Nay, Mr. <i>Locke</i> himself was so sensible of
this, that tho’ he advises washing the Feet
daily in cold Water, he would have it begun
with in the Spring, and the Water luke-warm,
and made colder and colder by Degrees:
“For (says he) it is to be observ’d
in this, as in all other Alterations from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
our ordinary Way of living, the Changes
must be made by gentle and insensible
Degrees.”</p>

<p>The next Mean is, that Children have
always dry Shoes. There is a great deal of
Mischief attends the mistaken Delicacy of
Shoes. Those who always tread on Carpets,
who never go abroad without a Coach
or a Chair, may perhaps wear with Safety
the thinnest that can be made; but to see
People in inferior Life, or those engaged in
real Business, trampling thro’ dirty Streets,
and soaking their Paper-soals in continual
Puddles, is surely every way absurd: but as
this Practice is evidently detrimental to
Health, as it frequently occasions Coughs,
sore Eyes, Head-ach, Rheumatism, and
other Disorders, it is highly incumbent on
Parents to keep Children free from these
Dangers by using them, in Winter especially,
to such Shoes as will keep them dry. On
this Head it will not be amiss to give a Caution
against Shoes that pinch. Parents must
be attentive to this both in Boys and Girls,
for many by this Means are made so tender-footed,
and have such painful Corns, that
they are a kind of Cripples their whole Lives:
and are not only very uncomfortable to
themselves, but are often thereby greatly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
disabled from doing their necessary Business.</p>

<p>I must not here omit, so far as relates to
Health, to mention Sleeping, and the Circumstances
attending it. “Of all (says Mr.
<i>Locke</i>) which looks soft and effeminate,
nothing is more to be indulged Children
than Sleep. In this alone they are to be
permitted to have their full Satisfaction,
nothing contributing more to the Growth
and Health of Children than Sleep.” I
have already with regard to Infants shewn,
that they ought not to be disturbed from
their Rest; and even past that Age Sleep
affords them great Nourishment. Nothing
certainly is more injudicious and unnatural
than the Custom many Parents have of keeping
their Children up late. If they wish
them to be healthy, temperate, or wise, they
must create in them a Habit of early going
to Bed and early rising. As the many Conditions
in Life oblige, or at least lead People
to act differently, so it is extremely hard
to fix precise Rules herein; but in general,
’till Children approach nearly to Men and
Women, they would do best not to sit up to
see, much less to eat, a Family-supper at
nine o’Clock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>Lying on soft Beds is undoubtedly wrong;
the <i>French</i> have a good Custom of putting a
Matrass above the Feather-bed, which prevents
their sinking into a Softness very prejudicial
to Health. Soft Beds absorb too
much of our Juices, cause a greater Waste
than we can spare, enfeeble our whole Frame,
and have a remarkable Tendency to give a
Pain of Weakness in the Small of the Back,
by heating the Reins.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Locke</i>, amidst great good Sense, has
some Notions a little rigorous, which probably
are never followed, nor do they seem
altogether needful. He proposes that a
Child’s Bed be designedly ill made; that is,
sometimes high, sometimes low, sometimes
rough, sometimes smooth; for my part, I
am desirous to banish every ill-judged Tenderness,
every false Fondness; but as I
write for the Use of both Sexes, and all
Conditions, I cannot confine my Ideas to a
Tent or a Cabin. Let Children by all
Means lie on Matrasses instead of Beds, for
the Reasons already given; let them lie with
a Bolster only, and no Pillow, for it is not
good for them to have the Head high; let
them lie either on one Side or the other, and
not on the Back; and let them lie pretty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
straight in the Bed, yet not fully stretched
out, for that would impede the due Action
of the animal Functions, and render Sleep
less profitable to them. With regard to the
Form of their Beds, I think, Decency requires
that they be orderly and regular;
nor is there any Fear that a Change of Bed
will affect them, for most young People
sleep sound wherever they are laid.</p>

<p>It has been generally said, that we should
keep our Heads cool; and many on that
Principle, even tho’ their Heads are shaved,
lie without a Night-cap. I will not take
upon me to determine the Matter, but observe,
that the Night-air seems to require
some Guard; and many are of Opinion,
that lying with the Head warm is most
healthful; and particularly good for the
Hair, the Eyes, and the Teeth.</p>

<p>Another Observation I shall here make,
is, the Error of sleeping in small Rooms,
and by Choice in the lower Part of a House;
it is certainly right that we should have
Space for a due Circulation of Air that it
may not become thick and foul, which is
very common in close Bed-chambers; nor
should we lie surrounded with Curtains, for
that is confining ourselves to the Air within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
the small Compass of our Beds. Parents
would do well to let Children lie with the
Curtains undrawn; and even where they
have tender Constitutions, drawn only at
the Sides of the Bed; but never all round,
unless really sick: for this Practice, however
common, is highly erroneous.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the general Rules laid
down concerning Exercise, I must here observe,
that as Children advance in Life, that
is, when they approach to Men and Women,
great Regard should be had to the
Exercise suitable to their Circumstances and
Constitution; but these are too many to admit
of enlarging upon here. I will in brief
observe, that those who are hale receive the
greatest Advantage from walking; the tender,
especially the Hectical, and those who
have weak Nerves, cannot bear this Exercise
to any Degree, but gain Strength and
Vigor from riding on Horseback; and indeed
it often happens, where walking cannot
be borne without great Fatigue, and
waste of Strength and Spirits, riding, on
the contrary, not only gives Pleasure, but
increases both. Where Infirmity is so great,
which doubtless will sometimes happen, that
neither of these Exercises can be pursued,
then a Coach, or some ether Vehicle, should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
supply their Place; for it is of great Consequence
not totally to disuse Exercise: but
Parents must remember this is too indolent
in a State of Health; and is not by any
Means to be encouraged by Choice. Besides
these, there are many others under the
Name of Sports and Pastimes, which if well
regulated, and Care be taken that those engaged
in them do not injudiciously drink
cold Liquors, or otherwise expose themselves
to inclement Seasons, are very salutary;
such as Fencing, Dancing, Bowling,
Digging, Gardening, and many others; all
in their Nature good, and at times not to be
shunned, especially by those whose Life
would otherwise be inactive, those particularly
who are devoted to Study.</p>

<p>There are yet some farther things relative
to Health, which Parents must not disregard.
Constitutions are so variously formed,
that the same Employment which suits
one Child, will not another. If one is
closely confined to Study it will impair his
Health, and either shorten his Days, or
make him miserable: if another is engaged
in a laborious Business, his tender Frame,
perhaps, sinks under it: if a third is indulged
in an easy Occupation, where Action
would have suited his Frame, he becomes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
indolent, insipid, and infirm, a Burden to
himself and others. Lastly, there are Occupations
in Life whose Fumes are known
to affect us; and some Regard should be
had even to these, since the Health of our
Children is concerned: not that I here recommend
the Observance of each Nicety, or
would have Children afraid of every Vapour
that rises around them, or of every Employment
that is accompanied with Labour: no;
that would be making Life too painful, and
fix in our Children an unmanly Timorousness,
which would make them puny, frivolous
or hurtful; and would be swerving
from the Opinion of the greatest Men that
have studied and wrote on these Subjects:
For <i>Hippocrates</i>, <i>Celsus</i>, and all those who
were best acquainted with what Physicians
call the Non-naturals, maintain, that, besides
Temperance and Air, Exercise, and
that too of the most laborious Kind, particularly
Husbandry, is indispensably necessary
for Health. What then in general I here
advise, is, that Parents, in settling their
Children, have an Eye to their Health, at
the same time that they study their Interest
and Prosperity.</p>

<p>Having thus with real Pains, and an unfeigned
Desire to promote the Welfare of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
Mankind, pointed out the general Means of
preserving Health, and, I hope, set in a true
Light those Errors which usually tend to impair
or destroy it; if Parents seriously adhere
to the one, and avoid the other, their Children
will receive many and great Advantages
therefrom. It may be urged, that the Treatment
which suits one Child will not another;
and that general Rules are always subject to
particular Exceptions: I grant it. Still
this does not justify those Parents who submit
to no Rules at all. I have said before,
that all Laws give Parents the sole Power
of governing their Children; I may also
maintain that the same Laws oblige them to
do every thing to promote their Welfare.
Those who are unacquainted with the Duty
of a Parent, must learn; those who know,
must practice. Let this Admonition then
rouse the Attention of Parents; and let these
Precepts serve as the Foundation, whereon to
build the solid Health of their Children.
The Constitution is like the Countenance,
somewhat different in every one; where
therefore any Deviations from Rule are the
Effect of Judgment, I sincerely applaud
them; and where any Principle here laid
down proves erroneous, I chearfully submit
to the Removal of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>Many of my Readers will still perhaps expect,
that something should be said concerning
the manner of treating Children in Sickness;
but they must remember, that I set
out with no farther View than the preserving
Health, by avoiding every Irregularity and
Excess: and when Diseases happen, which
cannot be obviated, nor even foreseen, it is not
the reading a single Volume that will qualify
Parents to undertake the Cure of them: no;
they must apply to those who make it their
Study and their Profession; to those whose
Judgment, whose Integrity, and whose Diligence
they can confide in. To this End I
will here endeavour to point out to Parents
the most rational Way of proceeding.</p>

<p>One would imagine, that nothing was easier
to determine than this Matter; for what
can be more natural in Sickness, than sending
for a Physician? He who from his
Youth has laboured to acquire Knowledge,
who has devoted his Life to Study, who
has searched into Nature, and discovered the
most hidden Causes; who has sacrificed
many even of the innocent Pleasures of Life,
that he might become useful to Mankind;
and who, to accomplish this, has spent perhaps
a good younger Son’s Portion. Can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
any thing, I say, be more natural or more
rational than this Proceeding? And yet,
who is there that has any Knowledge of the
World, that is acquainted with <i>London</i> particularly,
that does not daily see a very different
Practice? Who is there that does not
know, that the Apothecary, the Nurse, the
Quack, and many others, oftentimes baffle
the Physician, or keep him out of Play.</p>

<p>Every Nation is distinguished for some
Peculiarities of it’s own. In <i>France</i> the Physicians
have but little Dignity, and their Fees
are low; yet nobody in Sickness presumes
to act without them; they are always call’d
first: in <i>England</i>, the Reputation of Physicians
is deservedly great; but their Fees are
high, and they are usually call’d in last. As
Sickness is in it’s Nature every Way expensive,
as the Doctor’s Fee is always Gold, we
cannot but be sensible, that there are many
People in the Nation, who either from a
Desire to contract the Expence, or from a
Want of Ability to give the customary Fees,
do not, at least ’till Danger threatens, send
for a Physician. And it is for these, and
other Reasons, that some Medium between
the Patient and the Physician seems necessary:
which Medium is no where to be
found, but in the Apothecary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>Let us now enquire a little into the Nature
of the Apothecary’s Business, and see
of what Use he is to Mankind. Pharmacy,
the Apothecary’s Art, is branch’d out of
Physic; for as now the Apothecary sometimes
prescribes, so originally the Physician
was Apothecary too. An Apothecary’s Education
is not so deep, nor his Application to
Study usually so close, as the Physician’s:
yet as Genius is not confined to the Physician,
but is by Nature as capable of residing
in the Apothecary; some Degree of Learning,
an Acquaintance with proper Books,
which are equally open to both, and constant
Observation on Diseases, will certainly
furnish him with a considerable Stock of useful
Knowledge. Experience is the Mother
of Wisdom. While the Physician is labouring
at Theories, the Apothecary is perhaps
deeply immers’d in Practice: and as all allow
that nice Observation is of vast Use in
Physic, while the one is searching into
Causes, the other, if he improves as he
ought the Opportunities he is furnished
with, gains a Knowledge of Effects. Hence
it appears, that an Apothecary is capable of
being, not merely an useful, but a valuable
Man to Society; and perhaps equally so,
both to Patient and Physician. Physicians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
could not keep up their Dignity, nor act
with Safety without this Medium. Who is
it they confide in that the Drugs are good,
and the Letter of the Prescription faithfully
adhered to, but the Apothecary? Who is
it that gives the Patient that close Attendance
he frequently wants, but the Apothecary?
Who is it that has the Trouble of applying
Leeches, of applying and dressing Blisters,
of administering Vomits, <i>&amp;c.</i> of watching
the various Changes that arise, and of running
in Pursuit of the Doctor to check some
threatening Symptom, but the Apothecary?
And who is it, in fine, that on every Emergency,
in every real or fancied Danger, is
called out of his Bed to administer some
speedy Relief, or appease some groundless
Fears of the Patient, or their Friends, but
the Apothecary? Still all this, tho’ literally
true, tho’ it proves the Apothecary (where
a good one) to have some real Importance,
yet it does not put him upon a Level with
the Physician, much less justify the shutting
him out from Practice. Those who deny
that Apothecaries can sometimes cure Diseases,
flatly contradict what every Day’s Experience
proves; and those, who, to magnify
them, depreciate the Physicians, are
guilty of an Injustice, which can have no
other Source than Ignorance, or an evil Mind:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
for, to put Things upon a fair Footing, the
Apothecary should be considered as an
Auxiliary; or, as I have before expressed
it, a necessary Medium between Physician
and Patient.</p>

<p>Health is a nice Affair; and Life precious
to every Individual. The best Advice
then I can give to Parents is, that they do
not, where these are at Stake, hazard either
one or the other by Indolence, or an ill-tim’d
Frugality. Those who are rich, let
them at once send for the Physician, especially
if it be a Matter of Moment; and
surely Prudence points out this to us: so
those who cannot reach the best, let them
take the next best; that is, where calling in
a Physician would too sensibly affect their
Circumstances, Prudence demands, that
they employ a good Apothecary. And even
these, tho’ they consult their Apothecary
first, should strain a Point where Danger
threatens; and neither attach themselves
too closely to the Man who is fond of his
own Judgment, nor condemn another’s
Tenderness in proposing farther Advice.
But I may on this Point say farther, that it
is sometimes the greatest Proof of Wisdom
in an Apothecary to desire the Advice of
a Physician; for tho’ Diligence, Integrity,
and many other Qualifications are highly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
necessary in this Profession, yet none is equal
to that Penetration, which gives him the
Power of seeing Danger before it is too late
to apply a Remedy.</p>

<p>As for the Calumnies, the Sneers, and the
Misrepresentations of ignorant or designing
People, such as Apothecaries and Physicians
being in league together, and playing into
one another’s Hands; the Eleven-pence in
the Shilling; the cramming People with
Physic they do not want; and much more
of the like Nature; these are things that
scarcely deserve any Notice. I have now
been above thirty Years in the Business; have
seen and done far from an inconsiderable
Share; have attended with Physicians of
every Rank, from those who first enter’d into
Practice up to those who have reach’d the
Summit; yet cannot charge either any single
Physician, or myself, with even an Attempt
to enter into an Association to the Prejudice
of Mankind. On the contrary, I have seen
some who have laboured with disinterested
Zeal for their Benefit; not merely because
they could not have their Fees, but because
they would not take them. Here I cannot
help observing how much the World is misled
by Appearances; because People see an
Apothecary with a good Suit of Cloaths on,
they conclude he is above Want; and because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
they see another in a Chariot, they
pronounce him rich: so too because a very
few Physicians make Fortunes, they conclude,
that all of the Profession are Wealthy.
But how fallacious is all this! There is no
Profession, no Trade in the Kingdom which
we call genteel, that has so few rich Men in
it as the different Branches of Physic. Many
a Man in it, sensible that the World would
have no Opinion of his Skill, if he appeared
to Disadvantage, keeps up a Port with
aching Heart; many a Chariot is in daily
Danger of breaking down; and many owe
their Stability more to their own Patrimony,
to their Wives Portion, or some other fortunate
Event, than to the Produce of their
Business.</p>

<p>Two Things with respect to Sickness Parents
are to guard against; one is, the Neglect
of calling for Help in time; the other,
that amazing Attachment to Nurses, and
what they call good old Women. I esteem
it a Misfortune in a Family, where a Physician
or an Apothecary appears as regularly
as the Baker; and to prove that I do so, I
have said before, that our Food may often
be made our Physic; and have pointed out
many Ways to prevent Diseases: still it is
a Fact, that all Errors are best rectified at
the Beginning; and the sooner a Distemper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
is attacked, the sooner, in all Probability,
will it be conquered. Good Women are
extremely apt to treat physical People with
Contempt; and this chiefly to magnify their
own Skill. If they have any Knowledge,
as some of them doubtless have, to whom
principally do they owe it? Is it not from
conversing with physical People, and seeing
how they proceed? most certainly. And
yet these same good Women shall wonder
that any body sends for a Doctor or an Apothecary
to a sick Child! What, they cry,
do these People know about Children? A
good old Woman is better than all of them.
She must be a very good old Woman indeed,
that knows more than Men who have made
the Knowledge of Diseases the whole Study
of their Lives. But supposing that Reason
and Resolution get the better of this Weakness;
Parents have still more to do; it is
not enough that Medicines are prescribed,
they must be sure that they are taken. For
besides the Repugnance in the Child, there
is a Difficulty perhaps in the Nurse; and if
she thinks it wrong, it will be hard to set
her right; and harder still, to prevail on
her to give them to the Patient. Parents,
in this Case, must either resolve not to ask
Advice, or resolve to see the Medicines
taken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>Nurses have a Province of their own, in
which they are very valuable, that is, a diligent
attentive Care; for in vain do Parents
seek Advice, in vain do Physicians prescribe,
if Nurses are negligent, unwatchful, or careless.
But while I do them the Justice they
deserve, while I acknowledge the Merit of
their Station, and recommend that it be rewarded,
I cannot help repeating to Parents,
not to suffer them to baffle superior Knowledge.
If any Change happens to the Patient,
or a Difficulty arises unforeseen, let
them suspend for a Time the Execution of
the Orders given them; but let them not
frustrate the Physician’s Intention, by throwing
Medicines away, giving them by Halves,
or giving something of their own added to
it, or in it’s stead; and then concealing
what they have done: all these things are
grievously wrong, and every way unjustifiable,
as they frequently disappoint the Patient,
or disgrace the Physician. If a Nurse
has made any useful Observation on the Patient
(which all good Nurses sometimes will)
there is not a Doctor in the Kingdom, if a
Man of Sense, but will hear her, and turn
it to Advantage; but if her Conceit leads
her to set aside or overturn what is proposed,
however merry it may make herself, every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
thinking Person in the World must condemn
so capital an Error.</p>

<p>The last Caution I shall give to Parents
relative to Health, is, the Danger of Nostrums
and Quack-Medicines. I believe
there is not a Physician nor an Apothecary
in the Kingdom but what has seen the Lives
of People, particularly of Children, sacrificed
to this Practice. What is it that constitutes
the Physician, that proves the Man
of Judgment, but the varying his Prescriptions,
not only according to different Diseases,
but according to the different Circumstances
of the same Disease? And yet these
Nostrum-Mongers, with unparalell’d Boldness,
often attempt to conquer all Diseases
with one Arcanum, one pretended Remedy.
Who that hears these Boasters, or that reads
their printed Accounts, but must discover many
Absurdities on the very Face of them. The
Man that promises what is repugnant to
common Sense, argues himself either a Knave
or a Fool; and yet People are often so little
attentive, or so regardless of Health, that
they do not discover their Error, ’till it is
sometimes too late to remedy it. That I
may do strict Justice to every one, I am
ready to grant, that many Discoveries have
been made in Medicine by mere Accident;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
and that some of the Nostrums in Vogue
are in themselves good; nay some of them
were the Discoveries of able Physicians;
Discoveries since seiz’d on by designing
People, and pirated into a kind of Property.
But what does all this avail in the Hands of
ignorant People? What is a Man the wiser
for being placed in a Repository of the finest
Drugs, if he knows not how to apply them?
Or wherein does he differ from one set in a
Library of the choicest Books, without being
able to read? Yet are People every Day
vending Things, which they know not the
Nature nor Use of; and so far impose on
the weak and credulous, as often to make a
Fortune at others Cost.</p>

<p>Opium, Mercury, and all the powerful
Drugs, are every Day scattered about the
Kingdom, and indiscriminately offered to
all, whether they want them or not, whether
they are good for them or not; and the
specious Terms they are recommended in
are apt to mislead, not merely innocent,
but very sensible People. Since then
Things are so, Parents must be very wary
how they touch such dangerous Weapons.
’Tis great Odds but they mistake their
Child’s Disorder; ’tis great Odds that the
random Medicine they give is not suited to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
it; and how will they reconcile it to themselves
if any fatal Consequence ensues? Upon
the Whole, as a Friend to Mankind,
independent of any private Interest, as one
who aims at the Benefit of Society, and
wishes to preserve the rising Generation, I
cannot but advise Parents to be tender, circumspect,
and judicious, in so important a
Matter as their Children’s Health. When
they are well, let them use every prudent
Means to keep them so; if they are ill, let
them ask good Advice; by which Means
they will often save their Children’s Lives:
and even where a Miscarriage happens, their
Prudence and Justice will be attended with
this Consolation, that they have done their
best.</p>

<h2>MANNERS.</h2>

<p>Manners comes next under my
Consideration: it implies such a Government
of our Children as tends to regulate
their Conduct, by making their Actions
what they ought to be. And though Health
has been treated first, from it’s being generally
thought the most immediately necessary,
yet if this Regulation, this due Government
does not accompany every Endeavour
to preserve their Children’s Health, Parents
will often be disappointed, and find
their Labour fruitless.</p>

<p>The Basis of Government is Authority:
without that, in vain do we expect any Order
in our Children, any Happiness to ourselves.
Cities, Armies, Kingdoms, all are
sustain’d by it: and so too must private Families
be. By Authority I do not mean that
stern Brow, that trembling awful Distance,
nor that Bashaw-like Behaviour, which favours
more of the Tyrant than of the Parent;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
no: I mean a rational, yet absolute
Exercise of a Degree of Power, necessary for
the regulating the Actions and Dispositions
of Children, ’till they become wise enough
to govern themselves. But because some
Children attain this necessary Knowledge
sooner than others, and one Child will be
better able to conduct itself at fifteen, than
another at twenty, or even thirty; there
is but one general way of ascertaining the
length of Time our Authority should be exercised
in it’s full Force; which is that settled
by the Laws of our Kingdom; viz. ’till
the Age of twenty-one. And if we can
once seriously resolve to employ this Term
so critical to Children, solely to their Advantage,
Authority will thenceforward become
useless: it’s Terrors will vanish, and
be wholly absorbed in the united Considerations
of the Parent, the Friend, and the
Companion: in a Word, our Children well
conducted to this Age will afterwards take as
much Pains to make us happy, as we have
done to make them wise. But to proceed.</p>

<p>As soon as a Child discovers the first Dispositions
to Perversity and Self-will (which
as sure as it is born it will too soon begin to
do) I advise most earnestly that it be attended
to; for much depends upon it. Here I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
must caution my Fair Readers in particular,
not to suspect me of Cruelty; since the Pains
I am taking is intended to prevent the Necessity
of using any Severity during our
whole Lives. But what! you’ll say, should
a Child be corrected before it can speak?
I answer, that the first Principle in human
Nature is Self-love; Reason, the second
Principle, opens only by degrees. Now as
soon as the Passions of Children shew themselves,
they should certainly be checked: and
as the Fear of Chastisement is included in
Self-love, it is easy to turn this to their Advantage,
’till Reason shall have gained so
much Strength as to render it unnecessary:
no one can absolutely fix the Time, but
within the Year most Parents will find a Necessity
to begin; and before half the first
Septenary is past much may be done.</p>

<p>In the Government of Children Parents
should be obstinately good; that is, set out
upon right Principles, and then pursue them
with Spirit and Resolution: otherwise their
Children will soon grow too cunning for
them, and take the Advantage of their
Weakness.</p>

<p>Severe and frequent Whipping is I think
a very bad Practice; it inflames the Skin, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
puts the Blood into a Ferment, and there is
besides, a Meanness, a degree of Ignominy
attending it, which makes it very unbecoming:
still there may be Occasions which will
render it necessary; but I earnestly advise
that all the milder Methods be first try’d.
A coarse clamorous manner of enforcing
Obedience is also to be avoided; it is vulgar,
and nothing vulgar should be seen in the Behaviour
of Parents to their Children, because
through the Eyes and Ears it taints their tender
Minds: still, let Parents make their
Children both see and feel the Power they
have over them.</p>

<p>If a Child is passionate and wilful, a Look,
or a little Tap on the Hand, will, without
hurting it, sometimes suffice to convince it
that it is doing wrong; and will often cure
the Fault, or at least keep it under. A Child,
in a perverse Mood, throws down it’s Play-things;
if they are taken up fifty times successively,
they are still thrown down as long
as the Spirit of Contradiction lasts: now the
Remedy here should be to take them away;
or by a serious Countenance shew you are
displeased; and the Child will very probably
not only soon be quiet, but be less prone to
do the like another Time. I have seen Children
that could not speak, distinguish perfectly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
those who were disposed to spoil them,
from those who were not; scratch Faces,
break China, and play the tyrant over all
who humour’d them, and yet not offer to
lift a Finger against those who did not. By
all means let Children be play’d with, and
have every Amusement; but great care must
be taken to distinguish Play from Mischief;
innocent Freedom, from a growing Perversity.</p>

<p>The Humours even of Infants are innumerably
various. One Child will not sleep
but on a Lap; another there is no Peace with
unless rock’d in a Cradle; a third will cry
when a Candle is taken away; and to shew
us why it cry’d, it is quiet the Moment it
is brought back again; a fourth will swill
Tea or some other improper Liquor out of
measure and out of time; and a fifth will
eat Trash ’till it can eat nothing else, nor that
itself. In these Cases I advise Parents to
consider if their Children are acting for themselves,
or they for their Children: one Grain
of Judgment will set them right; one Minute’s
Reflection will shew them their Error;
but, when they once see it they must resolve
to avoid it for the future. I call’d some
time ago on a Friend, and took a Family
Dinner; when to my great Astonishment I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
saw little Master, not yet a Year old, drinking
Porter. What, said I, do you give the
Child strong Drink? Oh! Sir, reply’d
Mamma, he’ll drink nothing else. Now is
not the Fault of such Proceeding obvious?
and is not the Remedy as obvious? Parents
surely cannot be so blind as not to see their
Children’s Health impair’d, and their Humours
strengthen’d, by this misplac’d Indulgence;
and all for want of a little Resolution,
a gentle Correction, or a seasonable Reprimand;
nay perhaps only a Look; which
given with an authoritative Air, would often
have the desired Effect. Constant Experience
proves how wrong, nay how ineffectual,
the opposite Practice to this is; those who
give a Child every thing it cries or asks for,
strengthen indeed its Wilfulness, but are far
from making it happy. How many improper
Things are there which Parents give a
Child because they cannot quiet it? Who
has not seen a Picture, a Book, a Watch,
and other valuable things exposed to be destroyed
by it through this mistaken Management?
But surely it is right that even among
the Baubles contrived on purpose, the Parents,
not the Child, should have the Command
of them; that is, they should be given or
taken away at Discretion; and this without
Passion or Ill-nature on one Side, and without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
Clamour or Fretfulness on the other.
Parents should every Day more and more
convince their Children of their Power over
them, by restraining their little Irregularities,
and by weakening their Passions; now this
they cannot do without an early Attention
to their various Dispositions and Tempers;
that they may thence learn what Propensity
is strongest, what Foible is most predominant.</p>

<p>Nature, ’tis true, is not alike bountiful to
all; nor does she give the same Propensity,
the same Temper to all. One Child is born
with sweet and mild Dispositions; another
more sanguine, and full of Fire; a third
has a Redundance of Acrimony; and so on:
yet different Tempers are sometimes a kindness
bestow’d on us by Nature, on purpose
for us to act some certain Part on the great
Stage of Life. It is therefore the Parents
Business to watch the Temper of their Children;
to check any evil Tendency, any ill
Dispositions, and prevent every Excess from
growing into a Habit; nay more, to change
the bad Humour into a good one; as Physicians
administer Medicines to alter the Blood
and Juices. That famous Reply of <i>Socrates</i>
to the Phisiognomist was excellent: “Nature
(says he) intended me a Monster; but Reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
has made me what I am.” Cardinal
<i>Richlieu</i> (speaking of external Graces) says,
“Every thing to a Gentleman should be natural.”
Now it cannot be supposed that he
means, we should know how to speak, or
move, or dance gracefully, without being
taught; no, but these Things by Acquisition
should so far enter into us as to seem interwoven
in our Nature. Thus did Philosophy
change the Vices of <i>Socrates</i> into Virtues;
and thus should Parents correct and alter the
irregular Dispositions of their Children: they
must temper and moderate the Fire of one,
lest it grow too impetuous; they must animate
the Mildness of another with a Degree
of Warmth, lest it become sluggish; and
they must blunt and sweeten the Acrimony
of a third, lest it degenerate into Rancour;
which last Frame of Mind, as it is of all others
the most detestable in itself, and the most
dangerous to Society, so of all others it requires
the nicest Care to manage; in short
Parents, as I have already observed, are to let
their Children see and feel their Affection for
them, and their Power over them; and then
regulate their Actions as they find necessary.</p>

<p>I have still my Eye on Children in the first
Septenary, and with Concern view the Majority
of them humour’d, and therefore humoursome;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
Boys audacious and impudent
under the Name of courageous; and Girls
pert and vain under the name of witty. It
is my Opinion the Parents need not trouble
themselves much to reason with their Children
in this Stage; first let them consider
what is proper for them to do, or avoid;
then enforce their Compliance in soft and
winning Terms; or, if not with a smiling
Countenance, at least with a smooth Brow
and without harshness: but whenever they
attempt to disobey, let them shew by a Word
or a Look that they are absolute: which Method
I think should be seriously adhered to.
Though I have already observed that Children
have Knowledge much earlier than is
commonly imagined, they have yet no Judgment
to guide their Actions. What they
chiefly discover to us at this Age is Cunning;
therefore if Parents neglect Reproof
when necessary, they will soon get the better
of them. For Example, a Child cries
because it is to go to School; shall Parents
fondly to quiet it keep it at Home? by no
means. A Dose of Physic is to be taken;
shall they, because it is unpleasant, humour
the Child, and throw it away? no surely.
There is no other Method here but being
serious; you must go, you must take it;
when Children thus see their Parents in earnest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
Obedience very soon becomes familiar
and easy.</p>

<p>Nor is an unreasonable Compliance with
the Humours of Children what Parents take
it for; they falsely think it Tenderness and
Love; but far from it; it is Love degenerated
into Weakness and Folly. But it is
easy to soften this seeming Rigour in the Behaviour
of Parents, by their addressing the
Understandings of Children at other Intervals,
supposing it to be open. What more
natural and reasonable than to say to a Child,
You know, my Dear, all good Children do
as they are bid; all Children to become wise
must go to School; you would not surely be
rank’d among bad Children by being disobedient?
You would not, I hope, be a
Blockhead? yet if you do not apply to your
Learning you must be one. Thus too with
Regard to Medicines: You know, my Love,
Physic is to make you well; I am sorry
you have occasion to take it; I am sorry it
is unpleasant; but since it is necessary for
you, prove yourself a good Child, and take
it at once. Here I must beg leave to expostulate
with Parents on the Errors usually run
into in this last Particular. How comes it
that there is such an universal Difficulty in
getting Medicines down a sick Child’s Throat?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
How comes it that the most sprightly talkative
Child cannot be prevailed on to shew
its Tongue to the Doctor, yet the Moment
his Back is turn’d he will loll it out twenty
times? The Reason is plain; Parents do not
teach their Children to obey. Instead of
Compulsion or Reason, they use Flattery,
Bribes and Deceit: but I am practically
convinced that all this, however common,
is wrong: and indeed where Obedience is
not insisted on, and made a first Rule of
Action, few things can be right. As Medicines
are generally nauseous, a Repugnance
to take them is as natural as shrinking at
Pain; notwithstanding this, where they are
really necessary, and unless they are so, nobody
ought to be troubled with them, a
Child at any Age, from the very Day it is
born, till it is a Man or Woman, may, and
ought to be made to take them. But to do
this Parents must set out right; they must
have the Child under Command. That
every Parent is actuated by a Principle of
preserving the Life of their Child, I will
take for granted; but this is not enough:
they must go on to the Execution of the
Means. The Infant of a Day shews its Repugnance
to swallow a few Grains of Rhubarb;
the Child of a Year will twist it’s
Head about every Way it can, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
Spoon or Cup which contains the Dose may
not reach it’s Mouth; and by the time it is
three or four Years old, it will probably dash
the Cup out of the Hand of those who offer
the Potion, or tell them in plain Terms it
won’t take it. Now, without mentioning the
Consequence this may be of to it’s Health or
Life, there is another of great Importance;
namely, that a Child thus used to get the better
of all about it, and convinced it can conquer
it’s Parents, is seldom disposed to conquer
itself; so that where Self-will is very
strong, Reason will doubtless be weak; and
only serve to aggravate the Fault by fixing
an Error, perhaps for Life. Yet great as
all these Difficulties appear, they vanish at
the Entrance of Reflection and Resolution.
If Parents consider that they are bound by
every Tye to make their Children obey, and
then resolve to fulfil this Obligation, the
Business is done: therefore with regard to
Medicines, what have they more to do?
Nothing but the Execution, which may be
effected with Ease. For Example, take a
Child from it’s Birth to the Age of twenty-one,
and divide this Time into three, not
equal parts, but States; call the first the
unresisting State; the second the State of
Cunning; and the third the State of Reason.
The first is extremely short, we cannot count<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
it by Years, and scarcely by Months; nor
is there any Trouble here with Medicines,
but putting a Spoon or Cup to it’s Mouth,
and holding the Head back ’till the Dose is
swallowed. The second State lasts long;
and tho’ soft and winning Words are always
to be preferred, yet they seldom succeed
here; a serious Countenance and a resolute
Air are the surest Means to conquer; and
these maintained, there is nothing to fear.
The Difficulties of the third State, that of
Reason, are greatly lessened by the Success
of the preceding; for a Child habituated to
obey, looks back with Pleasure on it’s Compliance
with every reasonable Command;
and tho’ it before obey’d and took Medicines,
because it must, it now takes them
because it ought.</p>

<p>I cannot but be of Opinion, that every
Method in the Management of sick Children
contrary to this is erroneous; I think
I have seen all tried that is in the Power of
human Invention; and many who read this
cannot but be convinced that their own Endeavours
have often been fruitless. The first
Rule Parents are to lay down to themselves
is, never to deceive their Children; for
surely those who are to teach them never
to be deceitful, cannot but be very unfit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
Persons to deceive them themselves: nor
does this square with the Practice of quibbling
down a Dose of Physic, under a thousand
Shifts and Turns, and even manifest
Falshoods. The next Rule is, to avoid the
Practice of Bribes. Children should be
taught to know, that their greatest Happiness
is their Parents Love; therefore the Custom
of giving them Sugar-Plumbs, Cakes, Toys,
or Money for every thing they take, is grievously
wrong: it gives them a Fondness for
improper things; it gives them a restless
Desire for every new Bauble; and above all,
it gives them an early Mean-spiritedness;
an odious Selfishness; a Desire of being paid
for every thing they do.</p>

<p>At the same time that I recommend to
Parents never to call things by wrong
Names, never to attempt imposing on a
Child’s Senses or Understanding, or to force
down Medicines with Bribes; so I also recommend,
that they avoid Harshness and
Violence, unless pressed to it by great Necessity;
but this Caution is almost needless
after what has been said: for with the Method
proposed, it requires no more than to
approach the sick Bed with, Come, my
Dear, take your Dose; if the Child says, it
is nauseous, grant it: but at the same time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
say, We do not take Medicines for Pleasure,
but to make us well: if it declines it, urge
how wrong it is to dwell on what would be
gone in a Minute; and if any Difficulty still
remains, inform it, that it is not for your
Sake you urge it, but it’s own; and that
while you are doing all you can to restore it
to Health, you must, and will be obeyed.
At intermediate times, let Parents, by a
fond, engaging Behaviour, convince their
Children how tenderly they love them; let
them frequently mingle with them in their
little Plays and Sports; and let them sometimes
overlook Trifles, that they may have
more Influence in Matters of Moment.</p>

<p>Lord <i>Hallifax</i> observes, that the first Impressions
Children receive are in the Nursery;
whence he infers, that Mothers have
not only the earliest, but the most lasting
Influence over them.</p>

<p>That the first Care of Children, and many
of the most tender Offices they require, are
the Mother’s Province, is an undoubted
Truth; but when the forming their Manners
is under Consideration, the Influence of
both Father and Mother should, if possible,
be equal; at least it is necessary that Parents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
go hand in hand, and not counteract one
another in the Government of them.</p>

<p>Parents should make it a Rule to themselves,
never to shew to their Children, both
at once, the Marks of extreme Anger, or
excessive Fondness; but when a Child has
done such a Fault as demands of the Father
to affect great Severity, let the Mother put
on an equal Share of Lenity and Compassion
mixed with Grief: and so on the reverse.
Thus too on other Occasions, when the Mother
prudently exposes all the motherly Fondness
of her Heart, let the Father as prudently
conceal a Part of his, and, with an Air of
Steadiness, insinuate, that the Conduct which
is approved is no more than Duty. But Parents
will never be able to act with due Moderation
in the Government of their Children,
without first resolving to govern, with
the utmost Prudence, their own Passions
and Tempers. And how will they be able
to do this, unless they look inwardly, and
study to find them out? If the Man be of a
choleric or morose Disposition, and the Woman
of a phlegmatic, mild, and affable
Temper, the Contrast may prove sovereignly
beneficial to their Children, if the Parties,
conscious of it in themselves, resolve mutually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
to apply it under the Direction of Prudence;
and found the Government of their
young Family’s Passions on that of their
own. Whereas, if ignorant of their respective
Foibles, or heedless to turn them to
Advantage, they give a full Loose to them,
and agree in nothing but an unbridled Exertion
of them as Occasion or Accident offers,
the Contrast will probably prove fatal
both to themselves and their Children: they
will for the most part be pleased and displeased
alike out of Time and out of Measure;
their Severities and Lenities will often
jar, and rob each other of their due Effect;
their Punishments and Rewards, by being
never, or but seldom, and that by mere
Chance, proportioned to the Failings they
mean to correct, or the Merit they Wish to
encourage, will prove fruitless, if not destructive:
and what is still worse, they will
seldom fail, in the midst of Correction, to
strengthen the Misconduct they aim at reforming,
by the Example they give of it in
their own Persons; and as seldom miss, in
the Extravagance of their false Fondnesses,
of perverting the Minds of their Children
from the noble Love of Virtue, to the reptil
Hankerings after Rewards, Praises, and
Caresses. If a Child is to be reformed of
any peevish or passionate Behaviour, what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Effect can Correction have on him, if given
by a Parent delivered over by his own Passions
to all the Fierceness of a Brute? It
may make him hate the Correction, but can
never make him hate Faults, the opposite
Virtues to which he sees not the least Example
of in his Corrector. If another is to be
encouraged in some commendable Action,
what Benefit will he receive from an Excess
of Fondness, while the being humour’d in
other Actions, perhaps highly discommendable,
only teaches him to exchange Vice for
Vice, or one Folly for another? Or finally,
what Advantage can be produced to Children
from Reprehension or Approbation,
from Punishments or Rewards, however
well proportioned, timed or placed, if there
appear to them in the Parents a Dissention
in the bestowing them; and that they are
the Overflowings of Passion or Partiality,
rather than the Result of Reason and Equity?
Parents then should seriously acquaint
themselves with their own Tempers, and
mutually consent and agree on the Methods
of regulating their Children; never to reward
or punish, seem angry or pleas’d, but
by Concert; and above all, never to correct
while in a Passion, nor reward till the fond
Fit be over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>There are many things in the Management
of Children rather to be wished than
obtained; not so easily practised as desired;
among these, one Expedient, I think, might
often prove successful towards attaining this
happy Medium I have been speaking of.
Where a Father is of a choleric, hasty, and
severe Disposition, and the Mother the reverse,
which is most generally the Case, it
were greatly to be wished, that, by mutual
Consent, they sometimes exchanged Offices
in the Government of their Children.
Would the Father resolve to make it his
Study so to conquer his Temper, as seldom
or never, but in extreme Necessity, to interfere
in reprimanding and correcting his
Children, but rather to take upon him the
Office of Commendations and Rewards;
and of treating them with all the Affability
he is Master of: and would the Mother
take an equal Resolution to conquer the
Softness of her Nature, to reprimand and
punish them on proper Occasions with all
the Sternness she can summon; remitting
them for the Applause or Gratifications they
may deserve to their Father: would Parents,
I say, with these Dispositions, resolve on the
Practice, I cannot but think it would produce
excellent Effects in the Government of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
Children: considering the very little Danger
there would be of the choleric, or naturally
severe Father spoiling his Child by
Excess of Fondness; or the naturally tender
Mother ruining it by extreme Severity.</p>

<p>I will here suppose, what is most agreeable
to good Sense, that Parents in general
have such good Dispositions as to intend the
real Benefit of their Children; but either
that they have not thought on what was necessary
to be done, or thought on it but confusedly:
I will suppose too that both Father
and Mother agree in this general Intention.
Still, as all have their several Ways of judging,
the most sensible People will be liable
to have different Notions of different Things,
and even different Ways of doing the same
Thing; which, so far from being wrong, if
well attended to, may contribute to the
great Emolument of both. Yet Parents must
be extremely cautious never to differ about
the Government of Children in their Hearing;
it does incredible Mischief; but particularly,
it alienates them from their Duty;
and weakens the Authority of the Parents
on one Side at least, if not on both.</p>

<p>If a Child is to be in the Hands of a
Nursery-maid, (which is general among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
People of Condition) great Care should be
taken in the Choice of her. I am an Advocate
for Knowledge and Good-breeding,
but they are not so much wanted here. The
Requisites are, Cleanliness, Good-temper,
Docility, and Innocence. Every one allows,
and is sensible of the Benefit of Cleanliness;
and genuine Good-temper is no less advantageous;
but if with these Parents find a
tractable docile Mind, joined with a native
Innocence, they have found a Treasure;
and ought to prize it accordingly. The
Parents are to be their Children’s Guides,
and the sole Judges what ought to be done
for them; therefore I cannot but account it
a singular Happiness, when they find a Servant
who will treat their Children in the
Manner they require. But farther; a Servant
with this Turn of Temper, will every
Day improve in the Knowledge and Behaviour
necessary to her Station: and from seeing
the Reasonableness of the Parents Injunctions,
take pains to enforce them on the
Child.</p>

<p>But as a Variety of Circumstances in Life
may alter our Views; so we are often
obliged to vary our Mode of proceeding,
tho’ directed to the same Point. Thus it
sometimes happens, that a very young Couple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
become Parents, who are totally unacquainted
with what ought to be done; in
that Case, it is undoubtedly necessary that
they seek a Person already skilled in this important
Business; possessed too of all the
Requisites I have just pointed out: and such
an one with Care and Pains may be found.
As Misfortunes are but too common, so
there are Women who are not only well born,
but whose Education and Manner of Life is
truly virtuous; whose only Fault perhaps
is, that they inconsiderately married too
young; and whose Misfortune is, that Death
by depriving them of their Husbands, has
deprived them of Support: whence they are
glad to accept of a Service, which unexperienced
Parents ought as gladly to engage
them in, and reward them for.</p>

<p>It is not enough that Children have wise
and discreet Parents, who employ too a
faithful Deputy; no, they must also be
guarded from the Interposition of Friends
and Relations. They are dangerous Sharers
in our Government, and dangerous Rivals
in our Children’s Affections. No body surely
can mistake me so far as to think I would
exclude Relations from the Respect and
Duty due to them; by no means: they
may assist with their Counsel in the Absence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
of the Children, or they may encourage
filial Duty in the Absence of the Parents; but
in general they should not be allow’d to interfere
in the Management, nor on any Account
thwart the Parents Injunctions, or discover
opposite Sentiments in the Children’s
hearing. What more common than for a
Lady to have a Maiden Sister live with her,
who is pretty sure to spoil the Children by a
mistaken Fondness. A Child grows ungovernable,
and the Parents correct it; now
as Children are cunning before they are wise,
immediately it flies to it’s Aunt; who, with
eager Embraces, and pathetic Nonsense, seldom
fails to pervert the Parents Correction
with ill timed, and worse judg’d Consolations.
Is it not easy to see that Children by
this Party Management will be misled; and
that if it does not misguide their Affection,
it will at least weaken their Duty?</p>

<p>That Children have Knowledge very early
is plain to us a thousand different Ways, but
in none more evidently than their close Attachment,
their visible Fondness, for some
one Person, whether Father, Mother, Aunt,
or Nurse; though commonly it is the Mother
or Nurse, or whoever is most with
them, or most humours them. This Fondness
is perfectly natural, and we are not to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
be surprised at it; but my Readers must remember
it is the Parents Business to regulate
their Children’s Desires; and this they
cannot do, if they indulge and cherish a
blind Fondness in them, though it should
be even to themselves. Filial Affection in
it’s full Extent is undoubtedly an exalted
Virtue; still to be rational, it must be just:
and as there are many things which Parents
cannot lawfully command their Children to
do, so there are many things which Children
ought not to comply with, even though
commanded by a Parent. For Instance: if
a Man dislikes his Wife, or a Woman her
Husband (and melancholy Experience shews
us these things do happen, and that there is
sometimes a fix’d Aversion on one side or
both) is it therefore lawful for a Man to
teach his Children to hate their Mother; or
the reverse? by no means: nor can a Child
comply with so impious a Command. People
who know but little of Life, may think
such an Injunction impossible; but it is far
from it. Many Incidents approaching very
near to this are too frequently to be met
with; and I have myself the Pleasure of being
acquainted with a Gentleman, whose
whole Deportment is such as renders him
amiable in the Eyes of all who know him;
yet this Gentleman, when a Student, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
almost totally abandon’d by his Father, for
no other Reason than that of writing some
Letters of Duty and Affection to his Mother.
But to return to this first Fondness
we discover in Children. The Cause of it is
mostly owing to their being too much confined
to the Arms of one Person, or too
much indulg’d by another: yet whatever it
is owing to, the Effects are very disagreeable,
very inconvenient, and sometimes very
fatal.</p>

<p>When a Child is in the Arms of those it
is fond of, no body must meddle with it under
pain of a Slap on the Face; and tho’
this Behaviour is often put up with, and the
Parents persuade themselves it is pretty, yet
their Friends, when absent, seldom fail to
condemn them as the Cause of this Behaviour:
but should any one, regardless of the
Slaps, take the Child into their Arms, the
little Creature is immediately in a Rage, the
whole Company is thrown into Disorder,
and nothing can quiet it, but returning to
the Arms of the mistaken Fondler. Here
at one View is Error upon Error, Absurdity
upon Absurdity; the Child by this mistaken
Fondness is made miserable, and the Mother
or Nurse a Slave. Now to obviate this Inconvenience,
my Advice is, that every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
Child, after six Months old, be accustomed
to various Faces; be put into the Arms of
various People, young or old, fine or ordinary;
so as to make every one they see in
some Degree familiar: Parents are to make
their Children happy; keep them active,
lively, and smiling; and this they cannot
do, if they cherish or indulge in them a
Dislike of going to any other but themselves.
I know this Weakness in Mothers and
Nurses is attended with many Inconveniencies;
it creates in Children an early Fear;
often an unconquerable Shyness; it sours
their Temper, and strengthens their natural
Wilfulness; which last Effect is plain to
every Eye; for to make the Child quiet
they take it away from the Stranger; by
which Treatment it soon sees it can conquer
it’s Parents. But Parents encourage this
partial Fondness in Children, for fear they
should not love them: this is a Mistake;
for even Infants soon know their Mother or
Nurse; and soon too do they both see and
feel a Happiness in them they do not find in
others: like People who toil themselves
with Sights and Shows, they return to their
own Home, and enjoy a Content superior to
every thing they felt abroad.</p>

<p>Children, while young, may be compared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
to Machines; which are, or should be, put
in Motion, or stopped, at the Will of
others: but here it must be confessed, that
’till they are able to conduct themselves, they
stand in need of good Conductors. For
Example, Children have the Gift of Speech;
but to how perverse a Purpose, unless regulated?
Their Wit, their Cunning, or their
Knowledge, often serve but to mislead them;
serve but to strengthen the natural Corruption
of their Will. What is more common
than for a Child to make no Answer when
ask’d a Question? Or what more common
than for another, or perhaps the same in a
different Mood, to tire a whole Company
with incessant Prating? Now nothing can
regulate these but the Judgment of Parents;
the whole Machine, that is, the Words and
Actions of Children, are to be under their
Guidance alone: to this End, they must set
out with a Resolution to conquer; and never
quit the Field of Argument ’till they have.
When a Question is ask’d a Child, no Matter
by whom, whether by the Parents, a
Visitor, a Servant, or a Beggar, it must
never be suffered to go unanswered; all the
Rules of Breeding and Civility demand it;
and nothing can excuse a Non-compliance:
so, on the other hand, when a Child has a
fluent, voluble Tongue, and is disposed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
talk out of Time and Place, and to say perhaps
many improper or unbecoming things,
it must certainly be restrained. But tho’ I
urge this, it is not merely because Children
should speak or be silent; do a thing, or let
it alone, when bid; for however right or
pleasing all this is, it is far from being the
only Motive; no, it is the Influence the
opposite Behaviour will have on Children’s
future Lives that must be the Point in View.
A Child accustomed not to answer when
spoke to, will probably contract a morose,
dogged, or, at least, an uncivil Habit; another
suffered to out-talk every body in the
House, will be in Danger of becoming an
impertinent, if not an empty Prater; and if
a third is never refused the thing it asks for,
it will be but ill prepared to bear Disappointments.
Parents I know are apt to think nothing
of these Irregularities; but it is Inattention
to the first Errors, which lays the
Foundation of Vices for Life. What is it
distinguishes Mankind from all created Nature,
but that superior Power, Reason? Yet
what is it makes this noble Faculty, this
boasted Power, so often useless, nay destructive,
but the Corruption of the Will? Will
is a distinct Power in the Soul; but as it is
naturally corrupt, if Parents neglect an early
Restraint of it in their Children, it is great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
odds that their Reason will never be able to
conquer it: nay there are many who never
attempt the subjecting it; who banish every
thing which does not favour their Inclinations,
however irregular; and even among
those who struggle for Reason to gain the
Ascendant, the Combat is often unequal.
Hence appears the Necessity of attending to
the earliest Words and Actions of Children;
of observing the Biass they take; and of
moulding their tender Minds, that the first
Dawn of Reason may be cherished and improved
in them.</p>

<p>Parents should give their Children an
early and an ardent Love of Truth; in order
to this, it is not sufficient that they give
them Precepts, they must add Example too.
There is no Vice more dangerous, none
more odious, than a Habit of lying; and
yet none more common. But what is stranger
still, Parents themselves are often the Persons
who teach it them. It is very far from
being my Design to charge Parents with an
Intention of leading Children into this capital
Error; but that they do it either thro’
want of Thought, or want of Judgment, is
evident. First, they grossly mistake their
Children’s Capacity; and from a Notion that
they know nothing, say a thousand improper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
things in their hearing: then, when
they find themselves observed, are obliged
to use many Shifts and Turns to get rid of
their Curiosity and Importunity. The next
Cause is, that Parents do not make Duty
their Children’s Rule of Conduct. A Child
sees something in it’s Father’s Hand, and
asks, What is that? The Father answers,
Nothing. But why make so absurd a Reply?
Will not the Child in Return act the
same Part? <i>Jacky</i>, what have you got in
your Hand? Nothing. A Child sees it’s
Mother put Money, Fruit, or any thing
else in her Pocket, and asks for it; immediately
she replies she has none: the Child
taking the Conviction of it’s Senses, cries
for what it has seen; and the Mother, after
repeated Denials, has no other Way of pacifying
it, than the giving what it cries for;
and thus prove she has been maintaining a
Falsehood. I was once in Company with a
Lady, who with a sort of half Whisper, said
her poor little Girl had Worms, and she
must give her some Physic; Miss immediately
cries out, What, you are talking of
me now: No, no, Child, says Mamma: I
know you are, replies Miss; I heard you
talk of Physic, but I’ll not take any I am
resolved: No, my Dear, repeats Mamma,
I’m not talking about you; I’m talking of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
somebody that is in a Consumption. Surely
such Behaviour reflects greatly on the Understanding
or Conduct of Parents. Children
should be told their Duty without Disguise;
and it is certain they may often be
won to it by soft and gentle Means; but
Falsehoods, Prevarications, and puzzling
the Truth, can never be the Way to lead
them to it. Parents then, besides animating
their Children to a Love of Truth by daily
Advice, must themselves carefully avoid all
obscure ambiguous Language in their hearing;
all Signs, Nods, and Winks, which
can answer no other End than perplexing
their Understandings, or raising in them a
restless painful Curiosity. Sir <i>Roger L’Estrange</i>
tells a Story that pleases me for it’s thorough
Honesty. “A Man met an Acquaintance
in the Street: What, my Friend, says
he, have you got under your Coat?
Why, replies the other, what I have under
my Coat, I put there on purpose that
you might not know.” Thus Parents
without quibbling or evading, without
Harshness or Ill-nature, need only convince
their Children that all things are not proper
for them to have, nor all things fit for them
to know.</p>

<p>There is a Propensity in Nature which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
greatly deserves the Attention of Parents,
that is, Curiosity: and this when well regulated,
may without Impropriety be called
the Gate of Knowledge. How lifeless, spiritless,
and insipid, is a Child without it!
How pleasing, and how capable of daily
Improvement with it! Parents then ought
to cherish this Propensity, as it’s Use is
boundless. But tho’ Curiosity is in it’s Nature
a Means of Improvement, it is extremely
apt to degenerate into Impertinence; and
herein Parents cannot be too circumspect.
For as they are really two opposite Qualities,
the one a Virtue, the other a Vice; great
Care should be taken to praise and reward
the former, and discountenance and punish
the latter. Parents, besides the Instructions
and Encouragement they give to Children
in this Point, should throw them in the way
of exercising it, and attend to their Behaviour
when unconstrained. For Example; if
I never lock up my Books, my Children
will learn that they have the Liberty of reading
them, unless expressly forbid; so likewise
if I leave Letters or other Papers about
without reserve, they may with Freedom examine
them; and if they did not, I should
think them incurious: but if they look over
my Shoulder on purpose to see what I am
writing, if they break a Seal to read the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
Contents of a Letter, or pry into my Scrutore
because I have accidently left it open;
it will be easy for me to determine that they
are degenerating into Impertinence.</p>

<p>Useful Curiosity shews itself by innumerable
Enquiries into the various Productions
of Nature and Art; hence insensibly arises
in Children, a Love of Knowledge, and a
Love of Labour; hence too they learn to
distinguish the Useless from the Useful; what
they should pursue from what they should
avoid. Impertinence shews itself by prying
into the Affairs of others; employing their
Thoughts and Time about what does not
concern them, to the Detriment of all within
their Reach. Hence springs that Neglect
of real Knowledge we daily see in many; and
that Croud of Trifles which waste their
Time, and tend only to hurt others, and do
themselves no good. For in proportion to
the Time they spend in acting wrong, so
much do they lose of the Knowledge how
to act right. But besides it’s being so detrimental
and destructive to Society, Impertinence
has something in it so mean and hateful,
that Parents cannot do too much to keep
their Children free from it.</p>

<p>Parents should encourage in their Children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
a lively chearful Disposition; but quite pure,
and unmixt with Vice, however distant. In
order thereto, they should never suffer them,
for any consideration, to utter an indecent
Word, or commit any irregular Action which
has the least bad Tendency; but above all,
Parents must be careful themselves, never to
say or do any thing in their Presence that
they ought not to hear or see. This Caution
may seem unnecessary, since all acknowledge
how great the Force of Example is; yet if
we view the general Conduct of Fathers particularly,
we shall be obliged to own they
stand greatly in need of it. For what more
common than to hear Men swear and utter
many indecent Expressions before their Children?
And what more natural than their
Imitation of them? which Poison, when
once imbibed, cannot easily be expelled. As
my Aim in writing is purely the Hopes
of conveying Instruction, so I speak my
Thoughts with Freedom; and every one is
at liberty to take or leave what they like, or
what they find most necessary and applicable
to themselves: still I cannot help urging in
the strongest Terms, a strict Regard to Decency
as an universal and indispensable Obligation.
For whoever considers how naturally
propense we are to catch the Taint,
and how very hard it is to wipe it off, will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
surely agree with me, that those are much
the happiest who escape the Infection the
longest.</p>

<p>But besides the nicest Care with regard to
Words, Parents, as I have observed before,
should be greatly circumspect in their Actions.
Nothing gross or indecent should be
done in their Sight; a Mother should by no
means appear too much undressed in the
Presence of her Son; nor a Father in that
of his Daughter; for these and many other
things, though in themselves innocent, are
not allowable; they give Boys a Boldness
which borders on Impudence; and they are
apt to wean Girls from some Degree of that
Modesty they ought so carefully to preserve.</p>

<p>I cannot but recommend, what I doubt
very few will comply with, that Boys and
Girls, even when Infants, have not only separate
Beds, but, wherever it is practicable,
always lie in separate Rooms: nor should
they ever be exposed naked to one another,
or the least wanton Curiosity be permitted:
the Eyes and Ears convey Corruption to the
Mind; and we cannot begin too soon to shut
up every Avenue to Vice. I am sensible of
the Singularity of this Doctrine; but I am
firmly persuaded many good Effects would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
flow from the Practice of it. It is Matter
of Astonishment to me, to see discreet and
good People universally over-run with the
false Notion, that Children do not observe;
as if because they are Children, they neither
hear, nor see, nor feel: whence they often
lead them, or suffer them to be led very early
into some kinds of Knowledge, which should
be the last for them to learn. I grant indeed
that such is the general reigning Corruption,
that however carefully Parents avoid tainting
their Children’s Minds, they will still be exposed
to the Contagion of others; but if
they have the Happiness of seeing these
things always discountenanced by their Parents,
and are never suffered to copy the corrupt
Manners of others, the odds are greatly
in their Favour: but if after all they
should still turn out vicious, Parents will have
at least the consoling Reflection, that they
did every thing on their Part to prevent it.</p>

<p>At the same time that Parents are industrious
to make Children obedient to themselves,
they must teach them to consider
every one as an Individual of Society, and
give them a deep Sense of the Necessity of
good Behaviour to all, whatever be their
Circumstances or Condition. In every Family
there are particular Obligations which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
Children must be taught to distinguish, and
to reduce to Practice. Next to their Parents,
Children owe to all senior Relations, Respect
and Duty; to their Brothers and Sisters they
owe not only a tender but an unalterable
Affection; and all of more distant Kin have
a Claim of Respect which cannot be refused
them. Yet all this is but little, if compared
with the universal Demand Mankind have on
one another. We cannot without Injustice
deny Virtue and Merit our Esteem; old Age
is venerable, and to refuse the Honours due
to it, is a Degree of Impiety; Obligations
demand Gratitude; Misfortunes call for
Friendship and Compassion; and even Vice
and Folly demand our Pity and Concern,
nay more, demand our Endeavours to remove
them. But among the various Situations
in Life, that which most requires the
Care and Attention of Parents is, the teaching
Children a due Regard to People in Poverty
and Distress. It does not cost much
pains to give Children a proper and becoming
Behaviour to their Betters and Equals;
but to persuade them to maintain a considerable
Degree of Respect to Inferiors, or to
those in disadvantageous Circumstances, is
an arduous Task; still it may and ought to
be done. Nothing so humanizes the Soul,
nothing so strongly proves the Man, as sympathizing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
with, and relieving the Distresses
of our Fellow Creatures: ’tis then the Duty of
Parents never to let their Children speak or
act with the least Degree of Rudeness to the
lowest among Mankind; never to let them
divert themselves with their Rags or Misfortunes;
but on the contrary, they should
sometimes furnish them with Money or other
Things, that the Relief they design to give
the Needy may pass through their Hands:
and at the same time imprint this Truth on
their Minds; that he who is thus reduced
to ask, is often far more deserving than he
who bestows.</p>

<p>Another indispensable Duty of Parents to
their Children is, that they teach them never
to dare to sport with the natural Defects of
others. As an ingenious Author says,
“This Practice, though levelled at the Creature,
reflects on the Creator; it mocks the
Architect, and burlesques the Creation.”
’Tis strange that Persons of the best Understanding
so seldom reflect on this Point.
What can be more absurd than to ridicule
one Man for being too tall, and another for
being too short? one for having too little
Nose, another for having too much? The
Degrees of Beauty and Deformity are infinite;
and to be perfectly free from natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
Defects and Blemishes is the Lot of very few:
nor is it easy to fix the Standard of Beauty.
We know by Anatomy, Sculpture and
Painting, the general Rules of Symmetry
and Proportion, and thus easily distinguish
the gross Defects; but Beauty in the superlative
Degree, in it’s ultimate Perfection, is
not so readily determined. But farther;
what is beautiful in the Eye of one is not so
in the Eye of another; what was accounted
Beauty in some former Age or distant Country,
is not esteemed such at present. Since
then we see that ’tis our general Lot to be
more or less defective, and that All are made
by one Almighty Hand, how inhuman must
it be to insult or despise another for what, if
an Imperfection, it is not in his Power to
avoid; and that perhaps while the Insulter
himself is not free from other Blemishes,
full as obvious and offensive to many.</p>

<p>But the Defects of the Body are not alone
the Subject of our Ridicule; we sport too
with those of the Mind. Providence for
wise Reasons does not give to all alike; are
we therefore to hold another in contempt for
not knowing so much as ourselves? Are
we to laugh at a Man for not knowing what
he has had no opportunity to learn? no surely.
A Neglect to improve, and the Abuse of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
natural Talents, are the only things that deserve
the Scourge; and even here it often
happens, that he who exercises the Rod, deserves
it more than he who feels it. Such
however is the Partiality, such the false Practice
of Mankind. Can Parents then be too
careful to obviate these Errors in their Children?
Can they take too much Pains to imprint
on their Souls the Meanness and Folly
of such Mistakes? surely they cannot.</p>

<p>Another Caution equally necessary is, that
Parents utterly avoid all Distinction of Favourites
among their Children. Sometimes
the Father has his Darling, and the Mother
her’s; sometimes they both doat on the same
Child, and neglect the rest. Again, it is
frequently observed, that Mothers are extravagantly
fond of the Boys, and either treat
the Girls with a visible Indifference, or grossly
neglect them, they know not why. It is
true indeed that it may, and sometimes does
happen, that one Child in a Family is superior
in Parts to the rest, or is particularly
engaging, and may be said to merit that
partial Distinction Parents make; but to
shew that Reason is not always their Guide,
I appeal to general Observation, whether it
does not often happen, that the greatest Favourite
is the greatest Booby? Yet allowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
that a Lady loves her Son best, because he is
really a smart Fellow; it is possible those
very Qualifications she so much admires, and
which attract her to him to the Prejudice
of the other Children, are the things she
ought to be most displeased with; things,
which if sounded to the Bottom, would often
prove Vice or Folly. But supposing that
the favourite Son is really what he appears,
more amiable than the Girls; may not this
be owing to Accident or Design? May it
not be the Effects of superior Education, or
a greater Knowledge of Men and Manners?
most certainly. All young People are, what
they are, in proportion to the Opportunities
they have had of acquiring Knowledge, or
the Use they have made of them; so shut
them out from Opportunities, and they can
never improve; because they are deprived
of the Means: thus it often happens in Families;
the Boys are in the World, and gain
a Knowledge of good Behaviour; the Girls
are coop’d up, and Mamma wonders at their
Ignorance! But what farther increases a
Mother’s Surprize is, that she does not find
her Girls improve in proportion to the Opinion
she entertains of her own Abilities: now
allowing, what cannot be generally true,
that she has all that a Woman can be possessed
of, if they are confined to the Company<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
of her chiefly, their Knowledge of the World
will be very scanty. To be acquainted with
the World, we must see it; to know Mankind,
we must know their Faces, and mark
their Deportment; and from seeing a Variety
of Manners, must come the Power of polishing
our own.</p>

<p>I say not this as an Intimation to Parents,
that they ought to throw their Children wild
and untaught into the World, far from it;
on the contrary, I am convinced how much
they want to be fortified against it’s Snares;
and how nicely they ought to be conducted:
but with reference to the Matter in hand, I
would fain make Parents sensible how irregular,
nay how unjust their Partiality usually
is; particularly in banishing Children
from their Affections for not knowing what
they have had no Opportunity to learn. If
then Parents really intend the Good of their
Children, they must with the utmost Resolution
throw off all Partiality; if not, ’tis more
than probable it may greatly injure, or even
undo, a whole Family. The Darling is liable
to be ruined thro’ Indulgence; the rest,
thro’ Neglect and Ignorance. Children, by
this unequal Treatment, conceive a Hatred
to one another, and often to the Parents
themselves, which perhaps lasts as long as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
their Lives. But besides that, this injurious
Treatment debases their Minds, it is productive
of many dreadful Evils; for hence
proceed, not only inveterate Malice, but
Confusion, Law-suits and Poverty; and hence
too proceed rash, precipitate, and disgraceful
Marriages; with many other Calamities,
which it would require a Volume to
enumerate.</p>

<p>Parents should by all Means consider, that
every Child is equally the Object of their
Love and Care; and, by the Right of Nature,
equally demands their Protection. The Laws
indeed, for the Support of Families and Dignity,
have, in some Cases, made an Inequality
in the Distribution of Fortune, which
must be submitted to: still that does not take
off from the Obligation of Parents, nor
justify a blind or whimsical Partiality.
There is no Topic I would more enforce
than this, yet none more difficult to prescribe
Rules for. It is certain, that rewarding
the good, and punishing the bad, is both
a Virtue, and a Duty; yet at the same time
that I acknowledge how much the good
Child deserves, I cannot resolve to abandon
the bad: the Voice of Nature and Reason
cry out loudly against it. I will for once
suppose Parents entirely divested of Partiality,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
and that the Difference is really in the Children,
and not in themselves. Are they sure
there are no Faults in their Education? Are
they conscious that they have not exposed
them to be corrupted by others, tho’ they
have not done it themselves? Are they convinced
those Acts of Disobedience which
their Children commit are the Effects of
Malice prepense? or may they not be rather
the Sallies of thoughtless, giddy Youth? All
these things Parents must nicely weigh, before
they carry their Resentment against a
Child to Extremes. Let Parents reflect, that
a Boy whom they cannot now controul, and
whom perhaps they are going to expose to
the capricious Fury of the Seas, and deliver
up to an Academy of Vice and Profaneness
in order to reform him, may be much sooner
reclaimed by proper Pains and Remonstrances,
than by throwing him into the Jaws of Licentiousness:
for how often do we see a disorderly
Youth, touched, by a Parent’s well-timed
Clemency, with a Sense of his Mistakes;
and when the native Fire of his Youth
is abated, become truly wise and good;
a Pattern of Virtue, and an Honour to the
Age he lives in? Can Parents reflect on this,
and not resolve to try every Expedient before
that of disinheriting a Child, abandoning
him to Misery and Want, or giving him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
up to that Nursery of Immorality, the Sea?
My serious Advice in this Point is, that Parents
be not hasty in driving things to Extremities.
Let them with unwearied Patience
try every gentle Means in their Power; and
certainly by such Methods they will have the
fairest Chance to succeed. For if Children
see their Parents constantly aiming at their
general Good; if they find them hold the
Scale of Justice with an equal Hand; and
experience their Affection and Tenderness to
be void of Partiality, even after repeated
Provocations; if, I say, they once become
so happy as to reflect on these Circumstances
in their true Light, (as sooner or later undoubtedly
they will) I cannot but hope the
most abandoned will be reclaimed, and the
hardest Heart softened into Tenderness, Respect
and Duty. But here lies our common
Error; we grow impatient at a Child’s Disobedience
and Untowardness, and without
striking at the Root of his Vices, without
levelling at, and removing the Cause, we
dwell on the Effects; his Follies give us
Pain, and we do not try so much to cure
him, as to ease ourselves; and therefore
rashly remove him from our Sight by sending
him to Sea: in my Opinion, the last
Place in the Universe to make a bad Boy a
good one. I heard a Story some Years ago
of a rich Citizen of <i>London</i>, which deserves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
to be remember’d with Honour. He had a
Son, some Years past a Boy, addicted to
every Extravagance, and who had almost
worn out the Father’s Patience and Indulgence
by repeated Abuses of them, and by
continual Cravings. The Father at length
consulted a Friend, in order, if possible, to
devise a Remedy: when he had poured out
his Soul in Grief, and shewn that his Kindness
had been almost boundless; the Friend
replied, I have, Sir, a Remedy to propose,
that I think deserves the Experiment. The
World calls you a hundred thousand Pound
Man; but tho’ that may not be strictly true,
yet from my own Knowledge you are very
rich: throw at once ten thousand Pounds into
your Son’s Hands; that Sum cannot ruin
you, and it is possible it may save him. The
good old Man, with Heart full of Desire to
do whatever might convince his Son how
much he wish’d his Happiness, very readily
came into the Proposal: he sent for him accordingly,
and thus addressed him. “You
know, my Son, how dear I have always
held you; you know how much I have
desired your Happiness and Prosperity, by
the Pains I have taken to promote them;
but you do not consider how much you
have abused my Indulgence: your boundless
Love of expensive Pleasures has so far
blinded you, that you neither see my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
Kindness, nor your own Folly. But here,
take the utmost Proof of an afflicted Father’s
Fondness; take this ten thousand
Pound, and husband it as you please. If
you use it well, it will not be the last Favour
you may hope from my Tenderness:
but if you persist in the Abuse of my
Bounty, ’tis the sole Proof of it you must
ever expect.” The Son, struck with Amazement
at so much Goodness, and touched
with a deep Sense of his former Ingratitude,
from that Hour became all he ought
to be, and all his Father’s Heart could wish.
This genuine Relation may in great Measure
serve as a Guide to Parents. It is true
every one has not ten thousand pound to give;
but there are ten thousand Parents who may,
by exerting their several Capacities according
to their Station, preserve their Children
from the Ruin they are threaten’d with:
and thus turn them from Objects of Vexation
and Grief, into Instruments of Joy and
Happiness.</p>

<p>At the same time that the Authority of
Parents is to be maintain’d above every other
Consideration, Children should be taught to
love them to a superlative Degree. This Love
in Children to their Parents, will naturally
make them fly to them on every Emergence;
and thus Obedience will become a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
Pleasure: whereas if they are kept at a Distance
by an austere Behaviour, or are treated
in a cold, lifeless, insipid Manner, they will
be apt to doubt of their Parents Affection,
and be induced to seek Comfort from others:
and then no wonder if they fly to Aunts and
Cousins, when even the Servants, from the
Stable to the Kitchen, will have Power to
engage their tender Hearts, and rob Parents
of that superior Affection they ought so jealously
to engross to themselves. Nothing
requires more the Parents Attention, than
the preserving that golden Rule, a Medium
in their whole Conduct to their Children;
therefore while they are careful not to spoil
them by too much Indulgence, they should
at the same time study to win their Hearts.</p>

<p>Parents should be particularly careful not
to dispirit their Children; which undoubtedly
will have a bad Influence on their whole
future Conduct. There is a Degree of Courage
to be maintained that is not only graceful,
but absolutely necessary to carry us
thro’ Life, which Parents therefore must not
destroy. Some of my Readers may perhaps
think, that while I am enforcing Obedience,
I am myself undermining Courage; but let me
ask them whether a Soldier loses his Courage
by being under Discipline? by no
Means. On the contrary, a Consciousness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
of the Regularity of his Exercise, and of his
Skill in the Use of Arms, always animates
him in time of Danger: thus Children kept
in Decorum, and under a Habit of doing
right, will have far less Fear than those who
are acting as their Passions lead them: unless
indeed they are quite abandoned.</p>

<p>Courage discovers itself by a Command of
Countenance, a dauntless Air and Behaviour,
join’d with such a Degree of Respect,
Duty, and Self-knowledge, as shews it to be
free from Impudence and Self-conceit: it is
a Firmness of Spirit that enables us to encounter
every Danger when necessary; and
to demean ourselves in a proper Manner under
Trouble, Pain, and Disappointment.
But here Parents must be very careful to distinguish
false Courage from true, imaginary
Evils from real: let there be no trembling
about Hobgoblins, or dark Holes; no Stories
of Apparitions to raise Terror in the tender
Minds of Children: Parents should
never mention these things to them, nor, if
possible, suffer any body else to do it; unless
it be to laugh at, and expose the Folly
of them.</p>

<p>Nothing can be a greater Weakness than
the creating or cherishing these Fears in
Children: nay how senseless a thing is it to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
make them afraid of a dark Room, a Chimney-sweeper,
or whatever else can impress a
groundless or an unjust Fear on them; for
more or less they feel it their whole Lives,
and by that Means are oftentimes made very
miserable. Children, as soon as they can
distinguish, should be taught to look, and
move, and speak with Courage; and, as
they grow up, they should be put frequently
in the Way of exercising it, whereby many
natural or acquired Weaknesses will be conquered:
such as, a Fear of the Water, Riding,
and innumerable other things, which
Parents should by every Means endeavour
to prevent or remove: taking along with
them this Caution, not to treat those Children
whose Spirits are naturally weak, with the
same Freedom they do the more robust;
nor ever rashly expose them to real or imminent
Dangers.</p>

<p>There is another Species of Fear, so far
removed from Virtue and good Sense, that
Parents cannot do too much to banish it
from their Children’s Minds; I mean that
which is the Offspring of Superstition. What
Pity is it that this heathenish Principle should
ever find a Place in a Christian Breast: that
People who are taught to rely on Providence
alone, and who know that Happiness is the
infallible Reward of a virtuous Life, should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
nevertheless desert that Providence, and turn
their Backs on the Comforts and Advantages
annexed to it, to run in Search of Misery.
Fear is natural to the Soul of Man; but it
is Reason only that can fix it’s just Bounds.
If I have a Child in the <i>Indies</i>, and dream he
is dead, am I to be miserable till a Letter
from him convinces me of my Folly? If I
am about engaging in an Affair, of itself
not only innocent but laudable, am I to put
it off because it is an unlucky Day? or because
a senseless, withered Hag shakes her
Head over a Dish of Coffee-grounds, am I
to fear that Destruction is coming upon me?
No, no; all these are Instruments of Misery,
which nobody must meddle with who
claims being a rational Creature. Superstition
and Happiness are incompatible, as
every Day’s Experience proves. Parents
then, effectually to avoid these Evils, must
teach their Children a just Abhorrence of
Superstition; they must teach them too,
that the only Fear consistent with a Reliance
on Providence, and consistent with Virtue
and good Sense, is the Fear of doing wrong;
that is, of being vicious.</p>

<p>The general Indulgence of Parents to
their Children in gratifying their unreasonable
Humours, is no small Obstacle to their
Happiness; but that is not all, it disturbs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
the Oeconomy of the Family, and every
Day, perhaps every Hour, throws the
House into Disorder; and thus turns that
into Slavery and Vexation, which Providence
designed as a Comfort and a Blessing.
There is a well known pleasant Story which
seems not unsuitable here: A Lady gave her
Daughter, about three Years old, to the
Care of a Nursery-maid, with positive Orders
that Miss should never be suffered to
cry; Whatever she wants, says the Lady,
be sure let her have it; I will not have her
cry. The Maid soon grew weary of her
little Tyrant, and archly resolved on a Method
to convince Mamma of her Mistake.
Accordingly, one fine Evening, the Girl
put Miss into a Window; See, my Dear,
says she, see that pretty Moon; shall I give
you that pretty Moon to play with? In a
short time she work’d up the Child’s Fancy
so strongly, that nothing would quiet her
but the Moon. At length Mamma (upon
hearing her Child cry) in great Rage entered
the Room; How dare you, says she, let
my Child cry? Madam, replied the Maid,
Miss wants—Don’t tell me she wants; she
shall want nothing she has a Mind to have.
Madam, repeats the Maid, (as soon as she
could be heard) Miss wants the Moon; and
your Ladyship knows I can’t give it her.
The Lady was struck dumb; Miss still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
cried vehemently, and nothing could quiet
her, but a severe Whipping from Mamma’s
own Hands.</p>

<p>There are but two Ways of subduing the
Passions, <i>viz.</i> Force and Reason; but there
are a thousand Ways, and those daily used,
to inflame and strengthen them. When a
Child is accustomed to have all it asks for,
it soon becomes unreasonable in its Demands;
and in the End expects Impossibilities. Now
which is most eligible, to keep the Passions
regulated, and prevent their making great
Resistance; or to suffer them to rise to such
a Height, that all our After-care will not be
sufficient to check them? Parents then
should by all Means accustom themselves to
deny their Children some things, even such
as are innocent and reasonable; not indeed
to gratify a cruel Pleasure, for that they
should abhor, but to familiarize them to
Disappointments, that they may brook them
the better. Besides, by this Method, every
Grant from the Parents will be esteemed a
Favour, and received with Gratitude and
Alacrity; whereas the granting every thing
they ask, destroys the very Life and Spirit
of Compliance, and it ceases to be a Favour.
A little Judgment and Experience will shew
Parents how to vary these Grants and Denials,
if they do but attend to them; and if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
Children are under any Degree of Regulation,
nothing is more easy.</p>

<p>Yet this by no means implies that Children
are not sometimes to have what they
like; far from it: but the Regulation I
have been speaking of makes their own
Lives comfortable and easy; and at the
same time furnishes Parents with frequent
Opportunities of discovering their various
Inclinations and Propensities, and puts it in
their Power to confer many little Favours
on them, that otherwise they would not be
sensible of. For Example; there are two
Sorts of Meat at Table equally innocent; in
that Case Parents may sometimes, without
Impropriety, give a Child its Choice; this
Indulgence, when allowed without Clamour
or Rudeness in the Child, looks graceful,
gives it Spirit, and a pleasing Air: besides,
it affords Parents an Opportunity of discovering,
if a Child has any natural Antipathy,
any unconquerable Aversion, to certain
Kinds of Food; or any thing in its
Constitution that has a Repugnancy to certain
Meats, which, tho’ it may like, always
make it sick; all which must be distinguished
from Humour and Daintiness. But it
will be impossible to arrive at this Knowledge,
if my first Principle, Obedience, be
neglected; for if a Child be suffered always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
to have it’s own Humour, what a fantastical
Figure does it make at Table! I have
seen a sensible well-bred Woman sweat with
Confusion at the Behaviour of her Child,
and able to eat no Dinner herself for attending
to it’s Humours. One Minute it would
have one Meat, the next another; this was
too fat, and that was cut in the wrong
Place; by and by it would have something
else, and after all grow sullen, and not eat
half it’s Dinner: but Obedience obviates
this Confusion, and makes all calm and regular;
Children take whatever is given
them, and eat it without Reluctance or Reserve.
Thus while they see they are not to
be humoured, Parents will be at Leisure to
attend to them, and may easily observe what
Food should be generally given, and what
avoided; and thus too Parents might have
half a dozen Children at Dinner with Peace
and Joy, while the opposite Behaviour makes
one a Plague to the whole Table.</p>

<p>This Attention to Children will likewise
discover what Companions they like, and
often, why they like them; by which
Means Parents will be able to judge if their
Dispositions are good or bad; vulgar or polite;
tending to Vice or Virtue; all which
will furnish them with Hints for granting or
denying certain Acquaintance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>The same Rule Parents should observe,
thro’ the stated Actions of every Day; that
is to say, at Rising, Breakfast, Dressing,
School, Dinner, Supper, and Bed-time; all
are to be under such Regulation, that no
Opposition or Untowardness obstruct the
Order of their Designs: these I call the
stated Actions, because they are things that
constantly and regularly return; and Parents
should by all Means habituate their Children
to consider them as Acts of Obedience
and Duty that must be readily complied
with. On this Head I earnestly recommend,
that Parents introduce Order and Method
among their Children; by laying out their
Time, and allotting different Hours in the
Day for different Exercises; by which
Means all will go smoothly on, and render
their various Employments extremely easy.
Here I cannot help observing, how ready
People are to give opprobrious Names to
what they dislike or are Strangers to. A
Man, because he does not love Order, or
does not understand it, endeavours to brand
it with the Epithet of Formality; whereas
in reality, nothing considerable or truly important
can be carried on without it. How
comes it, that, besides the Artizans, and
other Day-labouring Men, we so regularly see
the Clerk in his Office, the Merchant upon
Change, the Physician with his Patient, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
the Judge on the Bench? but because the
Nature of our various Employments in Life
require it, and because Order is the Soul of
Action. To be convinced of this, we need
but view the first Elements of Learning,
where we find Letters and Figures always
ranged in the same exact Order. But we
may go farther, by observing, that Logicians
teach us the Arrangement even of our
Ideas; so indispensably necessary is Order
and Method for the conducting us through
Life. But while I urge the Usefulness and
Necessity of Order, I would not be understood
to mean a rigorous and starch’d Preciseness
in all we do; on the contrary, I
have already recommended, that Parents
endeavour to give their Children an easy and
a graceful Air. I am very sensible, that as
in the Productions of Nature there is often
displayed a beautiful Irregularity, thus Order
and stated Times may be dispensed with,
in some of the greatest Actions the Soul of
Man is capable of. And as in Wit the
sudden Propriety of the Thought and Expression
makes the Beauty of it; so in the
Exigencies of Life, an unpremeditated Act
of Benevolence, doubly proves the Goodness
of the Heart from which it flows: still as
Judgment is superior to Wit, so Order is
superior to Irregularity.</p>

<p>I have already recommended that Parents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
study to win their Children’s Hearts; and
it is on this Principle, that Love be made
to take the deepest Root in them. Love
and Fear are two great Springs of human
Actions; both which must be maintained,
both should by turns appear, but Love must
be predominant. Would Parents make their
Children good, let them daily instill into
them that noble Motive, Love. Would
they make their Children happy, let them
prove they desire it, by shewing their Love
to them. Would they make Duty a Pleasure,
let them teach their Children to love
it, by teaching them a chearful Obedience.
In the whole Oeconomy of human Life nothing
is so essential to Happiness as this Principle;
for as all Actions are, or should be guided
by some Principle or other, so those which
have a generous well-directed Love for their
Motive, bid fairest for attaining that genuine
Happiness, which all aspire at, but so few
find. Hence it is easy to see how necessary
it is for Parents to cherish in their Children
this great Principle of Virtue and Happiness;
’tis this keeps their Duty awake, and
turns that into Ease and Joy, which otherwise
would be a Burthen and a Pain; ’tis
this that stems the Torrent of irregular Actions,
and checks the rising Passions of our
Children, by producing in them the opposite
Effect, Fear; that is, a Fear of offending.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
Of all the important Steps necessary
for forming the Minds of Children, and for
conducting them thro’ Life with Happiness
to themselves and others, nothing is more
truly so, than the animating their Actions
with well-tempered Affection; it makes
them open, generous, and noble; and it
takes off that Narrowness of Mind and
Heart, so disadvantageous to themselves, and
so detrimental to Society: for in proportion
to the Affection they prove for their Parents,
so much will they increase in what in
their future Lives they bestow upon others.
Children who love their Parents as they
ought, will seldom fail to diffuse in social
Life a general Affection around them; they
will love their Husbands, their Wives, their
Children, and their Friends: nay they will
love the whole human Race, by promoting,
in some Degree or other, the Good of every
one within their Reach. Such are the Benefits
arising from a Love founded on just
Principles; such the Force of this Heaven-born
Quality!</p>

<p>I have observed that Fear is another great
Spring of human Actions; and were it only
such a Fear as Love creates, it would be
truly laudable. But Experience too sadly
proves how much Mankind are actuated by
a Fear of Pain, Disgrace, and Poverty; a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
Fear which, in it’s Nature, is servile, mean,
and base; such as Parents should seriously
endeavour to banish from their Children’s
Breasts. It may be reasonably asked, whether
this Baseness, this unworthy Fear, so
visible in the Majority of Men, be natural
or acquired? When we view indeed our
Children in some Individuals, and see them
forsake every generous Offer of being happy,
and cling immoveably to sordid Meanness,
we may, in these Instances, conclude it is Nature;
but when we consider them in the
Lump, and take a general Survey of the
Principles which guide their Actions, we
must surely own it is in great Measure acquired:
that is, the Dignity of Man is debased,
in an almost constant Succession from
Father to Son, by the false Estimation we
make of Happiness; by forsaking Reason’s
purest Streams, to follow our corrupt Passions.</p>

<p>To evince this, let me here descend a
little to Particulars. Parents desire their
Children’s Happiness, (I say nothing of those
Monsters who neither feel nor act the Parent’s
Part) but how do they attempt to reach it?
certainly in a Path the most remote from it.
No sooner have Children a Place on the great
Stage of the World, but their Will is irregularly
cherished; before they know where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
they are, or know to what End they have a
Being, their tender Minds are impressed
with Principles as opposite to Happiness as
Light to Darkness. Who first awakens in
them a Spirit of Resentment and fierce Revenge,
even before they can speak? Those
who beat the Floor, the Chair, the Table,
or whatever little Master has heedlessly run
against, and hurt himself with. Who first
inflames their Vanity, by kindling in them
Self-admiration, and a Passion for Dress?
Those who set out with teaching Miss to admire
herself only because she is fine. Who
is it raises in them a Thirst of Gain, an
early, and a sordid Love of Money? Those
who give a mean Reward the Preference to
Virtue; or who, by direct or oblique Insinuations,
persuade them that there is no
Happiness but in Riches. Who, in a Word,
exposes them to the Fury of every tempestuous
Passion, by opening the Flood-gates of
irregular Pleasures? Those who indulge
them in every thing they ask; who never
contradict their Humour, however irregular;
or who neglect to curb their Passions,
and subject them to Reason. From this
View of the too general Conduct of Parents,
we may with Reason infer that Fear, the
Spring which actuates the Majority of Mankind,
is more acquired than natural: for
where inordinate Desires are cherished, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
Fear of not obtaining what we wish, or of
losing what we possess, produces many Actions
unworthy ourselves: Actions not only
unjustifiable, but which constitute certain
Misery under the Mask of Happiness.</p>

<p>To obviate then these Evils, to prevent
the Acquisition of a base, mean, unmanly
Fear, and to lead Children into the Path to
Happiness, let Parents, as I have before recommended,
make Love take the deepest
Root in them, but as Fear will naturally
by turns prevail, let them with the warmest
Zeal labour to make it a Fear dictated by
Love, and guided by Reason.</p>

<p>But how shall this be effected unless Parents
act on right Principles? The grand
Obligations of Parents to their Children consist
in teaching them a Knowledge of themselves,
a Love of Duty, and a Love of Virtue.
Whence it is evident, that the Attention
of Parents to conduct their Children as
they ought, is indispensably necessary, even
to the third Stage of Life; but it is doubly
so at the Beginning. It is a judicious Observation,
that he who sets out wrong is half
undone; and tho’ this holds good in the general
Concerns of Life, yet it is no where
more applicable than in the false Steps taken
in the initiating our Children. For if Principles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
opposite to Self-knowledge, Duty and
Virtue, are either created, inculcated, or
cherished, where is the Wonder that Children
prove the reverse of what was expected? or
that while they seem to aim at Happiness
they find themselves wretched?</p>

<p>Those who build with Judgment, are always
careful to lay a solid Foundation. I
will now hope that Parents are sensible that
the general Practice in the Management of
Children is erroneous; and the general Neglect
of them unjustifiable. I will hope too,
that I have here shewn, however imperfectly,
that Virtue alone is the Basis on which
their Happiness is to be raised. An early
Obedience, a Love of Truth, a spotless Innocence,
and a becoming Courage, tempered
with Self-knowledge, make the Ground-work
of my Design; of that genuine Manners
I mean to recommend. The Edifice
however is still to be rear’d; that is, other
Virtues both general and particular are to be
taught, and brought into Habit: the whole
Frame of Mind and Heart must appear regular,
orderly, and beautiful; not accidentally
so, but resulting from Reflection; they
must be eager to embrace Virtue, and watchful
to shun Vice: in a Word, be always dispos’d
to do what is right, and never, with
Design, do what is wrong. Here perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
I should throw aside my Pen: if I have been
so happy as to convince Parents of their first
Mistakes in this important Work; those
once rectify’d, the rest may be supply’d by
abler Guides: for I neither have, nor pretend
to have, the Power requisite to display
or enforce those Virtues, the Knowledge
and Observance of which make up the Measure
of our Duty.</p>

<p>But to awaken Parents still farther, I must
observe, that teaching their Children all the
moral Duties is not only their Province, but
more or less their Obligation. A learned and
ingenious <i>French</i> Author says, that Parents
are the best Instructors, if they themselves
are well instructed. For, says he, “A Father
who has but two or three accustom’d
to respect him, finds no Difficulty in keeping
them to their Duty. He has them
constantly at home with him; he can take
the Hours when they are most docible;
he knows their Capacity, their Genius,
and their Inclinations. He can instruct
them at leisure, and allow the necessary
Time for it.” And a little farther he adds;
“What is here said of Fathers must in Proportion
be understood of Mothers, principally
in regard of their Daughters.”
Here then I recommend to Parents that they
do not content themselves with laying the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
Foundation, but labour on till the Superstructure
is raised and the Design compleated.
For as Men who justly aim at Reputation,
and who desire to fill with Honour
some Post or Profession, spare no Pains to
qualify themselves for it; so those, who
would fulfil the Design of Providence in
making them Parents, must take care that
they do not lead Children out upon the Stage
of the World, and leave them to act their
Part alone, till they have taught them those
Duties that will best secure Happiness both to
themselves and others.</p>

<p>It will still perhaps be expected that I
should treat of the farther Means to effect
this great End; but my Readers must remember,
that besides my being unequal to
the Task, besides my being confined to the
Compass of a small Volume, these important
Matters have already been handled by many
abler Pens, to which I refer them. However,
to answer in some measure a reasonable
Expectation, and farther to prove the Sincerity
of my Intentions, I will here touch
on those Virtues which are universally allowed
to be essentially necessary; and which all,
who would be esteemed wise and good, must
both know and practise.</p>

<p>We are now to suppose, that Children are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
considerably advanced; not only that their
first Lessons were Obedience, but that their
Minds have been tempered with Duty, and
with such a Knowledge of Right and
Wrong, as strongly to incline them to adhere
to the one and avoid the other: we will
suppose too, that their Reason, unblinded
by Passion, has gained so much Strength as
to be able to exert itself to advantage: that
is, that those Perceptions and Distinctions,
with many other things which natural Logic
is capable of teaching, have so far improved
their Understanding, and disposed their Will,
that they are fitted to receive more important
Lessons, and practise them when taught.</p>

<p>Prudence then comes first under Consideration:
it implies such an orderly Conduct
of our Words and Actions, as keeps us free
from those Irregularities which hurt ourselves
and offend others. Prudence is a Virtue attended
with innumerable good Effects, but
particularly as it frequently shuts the Door
not only against Misfortunes, but against
Injustice. It is not to be doubted but that
the Prudent are sometimes unfortunate. A
thousand Evils surround us, a thousand
Darts threaten our Destruction, which cannot
be obviated because they cannot be foreseen:
still it is certain that Prudence keeps off
many Calamities which would otherwise befall
us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>But besides the Advantages arising from
Prudence to ourselves, it makes us pleasing
and useful to others. Men naturally love to
converse with the Discreet; from them they
learn the Art of shunning those Rocks which
so many others have split on; from them
they discover a safer Path to tread in; and
from them they often labour to model their
own Actions. Farther, the Prudent are not
only pleasing, but valuable to Society. A
prudent Man is esteemed by all who have
any Dealing with him. Mankind have naturally
an Attachment to their Property;
therefore are they with great Reason inclined
to trust it in the Hands of the Discreet, rather
than the Indiscreet. Hence appears the
Necessity of teaching Children the Nature
and Advantages of Prudence; but as it is
one of the graver Virtues, it seldom appears
in young People, unless it be those who are
so happy as to have prudent Parents, that
labour to implant an early Habit of it in
them.</p>

<p>There is a natural Consciousness in the
Mind of Man of his own Significance; and
where he takes Prudence for his Guide, some
real Advantage may always be made of it.
No Man is so high as not to require the Aid
of those beneath him; no one so low but he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
may be useful to his Betters. Parents therefore
instead of inculcating on their Children
a false Pride, or raising in them a vain-glorious
Flame, should give them a due Sense
of others Significance and their own; this,
accompanied with Prudence, will shew them
the true light they stand in; shew them their
just Distance from those above them, their
Nearness to those beneath them. From this
View will arise not only that genuine Self-knowledge
so essentially necessary for their
Conduct in Life, but that becoming Pride,
which at the same time that it proves to them
the Obligation of acting in some certain
Sphere, animates them with Resolution to
behave in it as they ought.</p>

<p>Prudence is a Check to Extravagance,
Vice, and Folly; nay, it is often the Guide
of virtuous Actions; for even Benevolence,
Generosity, and Charity, Actions greatly
noble in themselves, unless well directed,
timed, and placed, will often be the Cause of
others Ruin and our own. Prudence therefore,
of all Virtues, may justly be call’d the
Balance that keeps us from Extremes.</p>

<p>I have elsewhere observed how dangerous
it is for Parents to rate their Children too
high; nor is it less so to sink them too low:
there is a certain Spirit to be maintained,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
without which our Children will degenerate
into Meanness; there is a Degree of Dignity
they must support, without which they will
become not merely useless, but burthensome:
Parents therefore must carefully attend to
this, lest in avoiding one Evil they fall into
another: And no Means so likely to gain
the Medium, as Self-knowledge under the
Direction of Prudence. By this they are
check’d in the Pride of towering too high;
and by this they are lifted from that Meanness
which Sloth, Ignorance, or false Humility
is apt to plunge them into.</p>

<p>Here I might expatiate on the Cruelty of
some Parents, who use every body well but
their own Children; who act not only the
Sovereign, but the Brute, the Tyrant, and
the Monster over those whom Nature calls
on them to cherish, comfort, and love:
and often, under the Pretext of making their
Children humble, harrass them into Misery,
and fix a Hatred to themselves. However,
I will not pursue a Reflection so shocking to
Nature; but rather hope that once to know
it will be a sufficient Motive for it’s Banishment.</p>

<p>But of all the Advantages attending Prudence,
there is none equal to the Bar it puts
against the Rashness of young People in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
plunging themselves into the Mistake of an
inconsiderate Marriage: and indeed were it
the sure Means of preventing this Evil alone,
it would both demand and deserve all the Attention
of Parents to lead their Children into
the Knowledge and Practice of it. How
few are those whose Passions never rise above
the Mark of Reason; how few whose Duty
never nods; what Grief does such a mistaken
Step bring on the Parents; what Care,
what Sorrow, what Misery on the Children!
Here, in the strongest Light, we may view
the necessity of Prudence. Suppose a Father
(one of some Figure and Circumstances)
educates his Son suitable to his Condition in
Life; and then engages him in Business,
either as a Clerk, an Apprentice, or whatever
Station occurs: at this Age, and in this Situation,
he is exposed to a thousand Dangers;
but particularly to that of a rash and
an unequal Marriage. The young Fellow,
if unguarded by Prudence, is open to all the
Arts, the Smiles, the Hypocrisy of some
one at least of the opposite Sex, who thinks
it her Business to make her Fortune; while
he, a Stranger to his own Heart, and ignorant
of the Consequences of such a Step, involves
himself in Sorrow, if not in Destruction.
The transient pleasing Dream once
past, he looks around him with Amazement!
but ’tis now too late! the Chain is link’d,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
the Fetters are tied, and nothing but Death
can break them! After various Contrivances
to conceal the rash Deed, at length it
reaches the Parents Ears. What a Scene of
Affliction is here! Not the lively Picture of
a Poet’s Fancy; not the fabled Representation
of romantic Distress; but real Life
overwhelmed with boundless Grief. A generous
Father who has spared no Cost to promote
his Son’s Felicity; a tender Mother,
who with endless Anxiety has sought the
fairest Prospect for her favourite Boy; view
them alternately struggling with Love, and
Rage, and Fear, and Resentment! What
must they feel to see their Expectations frustrated,
their utmost Wishes vanished, their
darling Child undone! We say, it is dangerous
to rouze a sleeping Lion; nor is it less
so, to kindle the Resentment of Parents:
for to be greatly exasperated is to fall into a
Frenzy, which we cannot stop at Will.
Thus it often happens with those whose Children
precipitate themselves into Misery;
their Rage becomes a continual Resentment,
or an unconquerable Hatred. And alas!
how dreadful are the Effects! What more
common than for a Child to be banished from
his Parents for a Step like this. I know not
what Effect a Description may have on those
who hear or read it, but, for my own Part,
I think a Child, who thro’ such gross Folly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
and Disobedience has shut himself out from
the Doors, the Hearts, the Affection of his
Parents, is in the most calamitous Situation
upon Earth.</p>

<p>But let us change the Scene. Let us suppose
the Parents Grief subsided, or that Love
and Pity have got the better of Resentment.
How fares it with the disproportioned Couple?
Does a Reconciliation with the Parents
secure Happiness to them? Alas, no; they
know but little of Life who conclude so.
There is always Danger in Disparity, especially
where Vanity or Ambition predominates.
The Woman who is suddenly lifted
up from a very low Condition, commonly
makes but an aukward Figure; and what is
worse, she is apt, in affecting to be like her
Betters, to misuse the Dominion she is invested
with; and, instead of demeaning herself
like a good Wife, she becomes a Vixen, a
Shrew or a Tyrant. Yet granting that none
of these Evils happen, granting that a Woman
has really Merit, and that the labours
to improve her natural Talents, in order to
suit them to her new Condition, there are
still other Evils to fear. Reflection on past
Folly naturally draws Resentment on the Object
of it: and tho’ when two Parties once
become Man and Wife, they are obliged to
maintain Fidelity, Tenderness and Love to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
one another; yet Experience unhappily shews
us that this Obligation is often violated. He
who is extravagantly fond without Regard
to Merit, will often be unreasonable without
Provocation. Thus, when a Man, in his
cooler Thoughts, compares what he is, with
what he might have been; reflects on what
he has lost in grasping imaginary Happiness,
or views himself, thro’ a Disparity of Years,
chained to faded Beauty, to declining Life,
while himself is in his Bloom; not all the
natural or acquired Merit of his Wife, not
all the Tenderness that can flow from the
sincerest Love will be able to balance his
Disappointment: he frets, and swears, and
raves, he breaks out into Extravagancies,
which frequently end in the Destruction of
them both; Destruction to their Peace, and
Destruction to their Fortune.</p>

<p>Nor is this Portrait of private Woe the
only one that can be represented. A thousand
others might be produced, all essentially
the same, all fraught with Misery, and
only different in circumstances or Degree. To
see the Heir of a great Estate forsake his Father’s
Mansion, and marry the Dairy-maid;
to see a young Lady trained up in all the
Pomp and Pride of Wealth, throw herself
into the Arms of a Man whose only Merit
perhaps is a deceitful Tongue, or a borrowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
lac’d Coat; or to see another steal to the
<i>Fleet</i> and marry her Father’s Footman; are
things so preposterous in their Nature, that
one cannot reflect on them without shuddering.</p>

<p>Certain it is, that great Merit sometimes
lies cover’d in Obscurity; and it is but justice
to render it conspicuous, by raising the Possessors
of it to an exalted Station. And farther,
a young Man, who has with great Pains
and Expence qualified himself to act in a
genteel Profession, tho’ he should not have a
Shilling in the World, has a Title to expect a
Fortune with a Wife; nor does he know his
own Significance if he neglects it: for allowing
that the Woman he marries has Personal
Merit, if they are balanced by the
same good Qualities on his Side, the Prospect
he has from his Trade or Profession is
often more than an Equivalent for the Advantages
he reaps by her Fortune. Nor is
it these things I mean to inveigh against;
what I condemn is in general far otherwise:
we see a wild Flame seize our Youth, Inclination
cherishes it, and they fall a Sacrifice
to their Imprudence. How happy then are
they whom Prudence guides; how consoling
the Reflection, that by steering with this
Pilot they escape the common Wreck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>Among the moral Virtues necessary to be
inculcated, among the Obligations of Parents
to their Children, nothing so much demands
their Diligence, Attention and Regard,
as the teaching them a Knowledge and
a Love of Justice. How noble is this Virtue!
how vast in it’s Extent! and, alas!
how little is it practised! Some Virtues stand
as it were alone, and may be separated from
every other; but this, when understood and
practised in it’s utmost Latitude, seems to
unite almost every Virtue to itself. Justice
teaches us all the Obligations we are bound
to maintain in Society; now it is certain
that these are many more than are generally
understood. Men soon learn those things
which the Laws take Cognizance of; and
therefore, unless quite wretched or abandoned,
avoid them; but what are these, if
compared to many others which Nature,
Reason and Reflection make us conscious of?
What are these to the many Injustices which
spring from Pride, Sloth, Lust, Avarice,
Slander and Revenge? Surely nothing. But
without enquiring what Actions evade the
Law, or triumph over it, I will endeavour
to give my Readers a true Idea of Justice;
and point out to them the proper Steps for
leading Children into the Exercise of it.</p>

<p>Here I cannot avoid returning back to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
Infancy of Children, nor help reminding
Parents of the Necessity of an early Care.
Virtuous Principles are the best Foundation
of virtuous Habits; and should the Seeds
of Passion be too deeply rooted in our Nature
to be extirpated, Reason, we know,
has Power to keep them in Subjection.
This premised, I recommend to Parents the
utmost Assiduity in shutting out the very
Source of Injustice; that is, they must
counteract those Passions which tend to produce
it; not only by inculcating the opposite
Virtues, but by frequent Reflections on the
Danger of cherishing irregular Desires.</p>

<p>Justice is to be considered as general and
particular; and tho’ Mankind are apt to content
themselves with a general Justice, yet it
can never claim the Merit of an exalted Virtue,
unless we both know and practise it in
particular. To attain this Knowledge and
Love of Justice, Children are to be taught,
even before they can speak, to part with any
thing they are in Possession of, and this readily,
and without Clamour: the Effect of
which will be, that when a little more advanced,
and they can distinguish their own
things from others, they will not eagerly desire
the Property of a Brother, a Sister, or
Play-fellow. The next Step is, that Parents
avoid with the utmost Caution every the least<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
Deceit, especially about Money, and every
thing which discovers to their Children a
Fondness for it. There is nothing more surprising
to me, than the universal Disregard
Parents have to the Presence of their Children;
a thousand things in Life are necessary
to be said and done which they, particularly
while young, should not be Witnesses to;
and yet are Parents every Day and Hour so
impolitic and so imprudent, as not only to
disclose their inmost Thoughts, but to transact
the most improper, nay perhaps the most
unjustifiable things before their Faces. As
Children seldom have Judgment to distinguish,
they can only catch Appearances.
Now suppose a Man in a just Cause has played
the Politician, and by the Force of Stratagem
recovered his Right; can it be a proper
Subject for Children to be in the hearing
of? But should this Man have gone farther,
and should he boast a Conquest unjustly
gain’d, perhaps to the Ruin of another;
what Effect must this have on the tender
Minds of Children? Children in general act
by Imitation; therefore, as far as can be,
they should see nothing but what they may
imitate. But farther, Children naturally
think those things right which they see done
by their Parents; therefore they should see
no Action in them but what is really so.
Farther still, Children, even under a virtuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
Education, are surrounded with a thousand
Incitements to Ill; their Eyes and Ears are
continually open, and continually receive
corrupt Impressions, which dart to the Mind
and Heart of the most innocent: where then
can they fly for an Antidote to this Poison?
To whom shall they have recourse; or by
whom shall they be furnished with Weapons
for their Defence? By those to whom
they are bound by every Tye; Parents
alone must stop the Torrent of every Evil
to their Children, not only by virtuous Precepts,
but by virtuous Example. For as it
is a certain Truth, that the Influence of Parents
is more than a Balance for a thousand
others, the Necessity of their opposing Vice
with Virtue, is every way apparent: nor is
it any where more so than in the noble Cause
of Justice.</p>

<p>This Rule established, I must again repeat
to Parents the avoiding before their
Children every Appearance of Deceit, and
every Fondness for Money. If Children are
taught to deceive, they will be induced to
practise it for the Sake of Gain; and if a
Love of Gain be cherished in them, they
will often use Deceit to acquire it. How
apt are Parents to Wish for Money in their
Children’s hearing; and this, not merely
the Indigent, those who want many of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
Comforts, the Necessaries of Life, but those
who have already perhaps more than they
make a good Use of. <i>Tom</i>, says a vain Father
to his Son, had I ten thousand Pound,
you should be the smartest Fellow in the
Kingdom, ne’er a Lord in the Land should
out-do you. Thus too, a doating Mother
addresses her Daughter, What Pity it is my
dear <i>Nancy</i> should not keep her Coach; so
sweet a Girl! Oh! that I was but rich, you
should marry nothing less than a Lord.
What must be the Effect of this Language?
Must it not inflame the Heart, or fly to the
Head and make it giddy? most certainly.
Nor does it stop here; for when this irregular
Love of Money is once deeply rooted, irregular
Steps will often be taken to make it thrive.</p>

<p>But to pursue the Idea of Justice, let me
not confine myself to the Passions, but
speak likewise to the Understanding. I will
hope that Parents have shewn Children in
Infancy the general Justice I have spoken
of; the obvious Rules of Right and Wrong;
and check’d in them every Shadow of Injustice:
that is, that they have taught them
never to meddle with Money, be it more or
less, or with whatever else belongs to another;
nor even to desire it; nor to be fond of
dwelling on it, counting it, or chinking it;
(for Money has a strange Effect on both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
Eyes and Ears:) never to put their Hands
into another’s Pockets; much less to unlock
a Scrutore: never to evade the Payment or
Acknowledgment of a single Farthing;
nor obtain unjustly even a Top, a Marble,
or whatever can be called the Property of
another. Farther, that as they advance,
Parents inform them that there is a constant
Intercourse between Man and Man: that
Providence has created some to labour one
way, some another; that the various Wants
of Life are to be supplied by the Care, the
Industry, and the Sagacity of each in their
several Stations; that the Poor are destined
to labour for the Rich, and the Rich to employ
and reward the Poor: that some in fine
are born to govern, others to be governed.
That this Intercourse is called Society;
and that Justice alone is the Band that connects
and ties it; consequently, that he is
the most valuable Member of Society, who
despising selfish or sinister Views, who shunning
the Tricks, the Frauds, the Villainies
of others, resolves to make Justice his Rule
of Action. That to this End, besides a general
Knowledge of Property, and an Acquaintance
with those Laws which are made
to defend it; besides the adjusting Profits in
Trade, stating Accounts fairly, and paying
Debts regularly; there are still many things
to be considered, some of which I will here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
endeavour to reason upon, as they visibly
produce some certain kind of Injustice in
their Effects, tho’ their Cause is often hid
from common Eyes, or they are disguised
by false or palliative Names.</p>

<p>The first Spring of Injustice is Pride.
Children, as I have just observed, have their
Minds impressed with a Love of Riches;
whence naturally follows an undue Degree
of Self-esteem, accompany’d with a Love of
Power, Show, and Dignity: now to effect
these, a thousand Stratagems are used; every
Obstacle which stands in the Way to Wealth
or Preferment must be overturned; every
Difficulty must be removed. Hence it is
easy to see that unjust Means will often be
used to gain the desired End; and hence it
is plain that those who ascend by indirect
and violent Measures, crush down many
others as they pass. Parents therefore to
obviate this, must teach their Children that
nothing can be lawful which injures others;
that they may indeed arrive at Honours and
acquire Riches; but that unless they are
obtained without Guilt, and possessed without
Pride, they cannot be just: for even allowing
that no undue Means are used to
support our Pride, there is Injustice riveted
to the Vice itself; for the Proud, to raise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
themselves, always attempt to depress or debase
others.</p>

<p>Another Cause of Injustice is Sloth. Providence
has created us to labour; the Head,
the Hands, the Feet, all are given to answer
in some Degree the same End; that is,
the Preservation of ourselves, and the Benefit
of others. None are born to be idle,
none who are so can with any Truth be said
to fill up Life as they ought. Those who
have Talents are bound to cultivate them as
far as they have Opportunity, that they
may counsel, instruct, or assist others: those
who have Fortune cannot without Injustice
neglect the Care, the Improvement, and the
Distribution of it: those who have no Fortune,
but enjoy Health and Limbs, are
Robbers of Society if they refuse to work:
and indeed among the various Objects of
Sloth, those who exercise neither Head, nor
Hands, nor Feet, but lounge and fawn and
beg for a Subsistence, no Matter whether in
Rags or Finery, are of all others the most
mean, at the same time that they are grossly
unjust. The Virtues opposite to this are,
Industry, Application, and Oeconomy;
which Parents must raise in their Children
betimes, and cherish with Zeal and Pains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>A third Source of Injustice is Lust. What
I have before said of an universal Regard to
Decency both in Words and Actions must
not be confined to the State of Childhood,
but be enforced by Parents on their Children
as Rules that are never to be departed from;
since what is in it’s Nature wrong, nothing
can make right: for if Innocence be a Virtue,
which even the abandoned will hardly
dispute, every Deviation from it must be
more or less a Vice. As this then is a settled
point, enlarging on it here is needless;
my only Aim on this Head being to make
some Reflections on the Vice when manifestly
attended with Injustice.</p>

<p>It has been the Custom of every wise Nation
both in their Writings and Conversation,
to inculcate and enforce the finest Morals,
the most important Truths under an
Allegory or Fable; and where the Simile is
natural and the Expression emphatic, nothing
is more powerful. Suppose then a
Father should lead his Son, as he approaches
to Manhood, into a Garden, and thus address
him. “View here, my dear Child,
the Beauties of the Creation; see how
abundantly the Earth is furnished with all
that can contribute both to our Use and
Delight. But besides the unmeasurable
Bounty of Providence, behold the Gardener’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
incessant Toil; what pains he
takes to improve the Soil; with what
early Care does he water each tender
Plant; how watchful to secure them
against destroying Vermin, and how
anxious to defend his Flowers from Blasts!
Now tho’ Providence has given to <span class="smcap">Man</span>
a Power over all the Works of the Creation,
’twas never meant he should abuse
them. What then would you think of
him who should pluck the choicest
Flowers here, purely for the sake of destroying
them? But should he go farther,
and exercise a wanton Pleasure not only
in stripping them of their Beauty, but in
rendering them offensive and odious to
all who see them? What, my Son, I say,
would you think of such a Man? But
Oh! my dear Boy, should this affect you,
should this raise in you a Degree of Contempt;
with how much Indignation must
you behold the Wretch, who, with a
Complication of Crimes has deflowered
the fairest Part of the whole Creation:
not an inanimate Rose, or Pink, or Lilly;
but robb’d a spotless Virgin of her Innocence!
Tremble, my dear, dear Child,
tremble at the very Thought of so much
Baseness! View with impartial Eyes the
guilty Deed! On one side the Deceit, the
Oaths, the Perjuries, and a thousand criminal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
Inventions to gain the desired End;
on the other, the dreadful Change from
Innocence to Guilt; from Honour to Infamy;
from the Esteem of all, to the
Contempt of all; and what is stranger
still, forsaken and despised by the very
Seducer himself! Yet Oh! my Son, let
not these Reflections be made in vain;
but draw Profit from others Crimes: examine
them in their true Light; be not
misled by those who palliate the blackest
Actions with the specious Names of Wit,
and Love, and Gallantry; but live in a
Resolution never to share in their Guilt;
never to injure another in the least Degree;
but above all resolve to suffer a thousand
Evils, to sacrifice every Passion, rather
than even stain, much less destroy, the
Flower of Innocence.”</p>

<p>These are Sentiments our Sons must be
warmed with; these are Ideas of Justice
they must not be Strangers to, if we wish to
make them good Men, or desire to fulfil
our Obligations as Parents. Innocence,
wherever it resides, is an inestimable Treasure;
two things therefore Parents have to
do herein, viz. to teach their Children neither
to destroy another’s Innocence; nor
suffer others to sully theirs. The first has
just been spoken of: I will only add, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
the same Regard must be paid to all Degrees,
whether high or low: it is the Vice
we are to keep in view, not the Quality of
the Person. ’Tis no Extenuation of the
Crime, that a Gentleman’s Son seduced his
Master’s Cook; or that a young Nobleman
has ruined only a Tenant’s Daughter, or his
Mother’s Chamber-maid; no, no, there are
no Distinctions in Virtue’s Cause: that lost,
there are always some to weep; the poorest
have their Parents, their Relations, or their
Friends, to lament their sad Mishap; and
those who are robbed of what cannot be restored,
have always their own Loss to deplore.</p>

<p>The next Care of Parents on this Head is,
that they labour to preserve their Children’s
Innocence from being tainted by others. One
would imagine when Parents had taught
their Children every Virtue, and enforced
them by their own Example, their Duty
would be compleat; but far from it; they
have still the Obligation of representing to
them the Snares, the Artifices, the Villainies
of designing People. In my last View I
have shewn that our Sons, either hurried by
Passion, led by false Notions of Gallantry,
or Strangers to Right and Wrong, are often
the Instruments, or liable at least to be
the Instruments, of others Destruction: in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
this I must touch on the Necessity Children
are under of being defended from receiving
Injuries. And here I must observe, that
both Sexes are equally in Danger. The
Girls indeed have by Nature and Education
more Innocence, as well as more Tenderness;
the Boys, tho’ more robust, have more
Temptations. Men are the Instruments,
and dreadful ones too, which chiefly destroy
our Daughters; but bad Women on one
hand, and corrupt Men on the other, combine
to destroy our Sons. Let Parents then
point out to them the Dangers they are exposed
to, and furnish them with every
Means for their Defence; let them shew
that the Colours Vice is painted in are false
and delusive; that however pleasing the Appearances
are, the Effects are bitter; that
our corrupt Imagination is extremely apt to
mislead us, therefore they must not trust to
this Guide, but seek Security from Reason
and Reflection; that they must not rely on
their own Strength, by exposing themselves
to those who have the Subtlety and Cruelty
to form Designs against their Virtue; and
that, in these Cases, the greatest Proof they
can give of their Courage is to run away,
because their Passions naturally incline them
to stay; that those, in a word, who wish to
maintain their Virtue, must shun the Vicious:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
and where the Affairs of Life unavoidably
expose them to the Company of such,
let them by a constant discountenancing Deportment,
shew their Disapprobation of every
unbecoming Word or Action; whereby they
will check, and often prevent, any Attacks
on their Innocence. But farther, to enforce
the Virtue of Innocence, let Parents shew their
Children the Obligations they are under of
preserving it; that besides the Insult offered
to their Creator who made them rational Beings,
and thereby distinguished them from the
Brutes, their departing from it is an Injustice
to themselves, an Injustice to their Parents,
and to all those who have laboured to correct
the natural Corruption of their Hearts,
by instilling into them every virtuous Principle.</p>

<p>A fourth Cause of Injustice is Avarice:
which implies an inordinate Love of Gain.
Avarice puts on a thousand Shapes, and is
to be found in Men of every Rank and every
Age; but it is most apparent in the Rich
and the Old: which is an Aggravation of
the Vice; because the one have more than
enough already, and the other have not long
to enjoy the Fruits of it, even should they
live to reap them. But what is most alarming
in the Avaritious is, the extreme Danger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
of going beyond the Bounds of Justice;
and what <i>Dryden</i><a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> says of Wits and Madmen
may, by the easiest Change,<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> be apply’d
without Impropriety to the Covetous and the
Dishonest. How many Schemes are formed,
how many Devices used to raise a Fortune,
or to add Hoard to Hoard? One circumvents
another in Trade; and with more
than savage Cruelty, abuses the Power
he has by keeping those under that might
otherwise flourish; and had rather see another
starve, than himself be deprived of
what he does not want. A second burns with
a Thirst of Gaming, and values himself
for his superior Parts, if he can trick
another out of his Money at Play; regardless
of the dreadful Consequences attending
the Loss; and regardless of the Injustice of
the Acquisition. How do they possess their
Minds who have raised their Fortune on another’s
Ruin? Do they ever reflect on the
Misery of their wretched Companion; or
do they view the Distress of his Wife, his
Children, and his suffering Creditors? Surely
if the Gamester did this, even he who
wins, and wins by a fair Bet, and equal Lay,
must tremble at Riches thus acquired: but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
if to this be added the Traps, the Snares,
and other Artifices to draw in weak or unwary
Men to their Ruin, what must we
think of such Wretches? We may both pity
and condemn the Ruined, but we must abhor
those who caused it, however great their
false Triumph may be. A third takes the
Advantage of Distress or Weakness, and
lends his Money, not with Kindness, but
with a sordid View: these are the Men
who grasp at Mortgages for the sake of fore-closing;
and get Possession of an Estate for
half it’s Value; who inveigle a Widow that
they may ruin her Affairs, and enrich themselves;
or get a Guardianship that they may
beggar the Children. A fourth, sensible
what Power Riches give him, employs it
to the harrassing and depressing all beneath
him; these are those who to add to their superfluous
Wealth suck the Blood and Vitals
of the Poor, by reducing their just Pay, and
defrauding them of their Wages; or who
with inhuman Scorn depreciate that Merit
which others possess; or crush it in it’s Appearance.
But how shall Parents, who perhaps
may not live to be Witnesses to these
Actions, prevent them in their Children?
The Answer is easy. Imprint on them an
early Love of Justice; and as they advance,
shew them the various Ways of deviating
from it; that by viewing these things in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
their true Light, they may conceive a just
Horror of Crimes so detestable in themselves,
and so destructive to Society.</p>

<p>A fifth Source of Injustice is Slander.
There are Men who would not game another
out of his Money, nor forge a Deed,
tho’ they could obtain his Estate with Security,
nor run him thro’ the Body; yet shall,
without Scruple, butcher his Reputation
with Slander. An unbecoming Levity of
Conversation and Behaviour is natural to
many, who thereby do great Harm without
once being aware of it; but this, tho’
a great Evil in Society, is Innocence, if
compared with the Malevolence of others.
There are Men of such rancorous Hearts, of
such malicious Natures, that they seem to
have nothing human but the Form;
Wretches, who, to gratify their Spleen, or
to indulge a Pique, tear in Pieces the Good-name
of those whose Merit is perhaps superior
to their own. All the moral Writers
condemn this censuring, cruel Humour;
and a celebrated dramatic Poet<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> describes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
very beautifully the superior Loss of Reputation
to that of Riches. A Man that is
robbed on the High-way sees his Loss, and
knows the worst of it; but he who is levelled
at from afar, or receives a Stab in
the dark, neither discovers his Enemy, nor
knows where the Mischief will end. In the
great Family of the World, every one is
furnished with Means for his Support, be it
more or less; all are in some Degree possessed
of Power, Genius, or Abilities to procure,
if not a Fortune, at least Subsistence;
with what Face then does Mankind dare to
frustrate the Intention of Providence, by
robbing another of that Reputation which
he is labouring to establish, and by which
alone he is enabled to support his Wife,
his Children, and himself. With what
Pretensions, or by what Authority do
they presume to strip another of the Merit
he is possessed of? If I have less Merit than
another, let me labour to equal him; should
I perchance have more, let me not rob him
of the little he is possessed of. But Men of
this detestable Spirit imagine, that in making
others little, they render themselves
great; and thus unjustly use the Power they
are invested with, by abusing their Hearers
Ears; prostituting their own Tongues to
the Destruction of others; and, lest Words
should sometimes be ineffectual, they add<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
Nods, Winks, Shrugs, and whatever can
express Malice, Hatred, or Contempt. Pure
Morality teaches us to throw a Veil over
others Faults; but Justice demands that we
stifle not their Virtues, much less pervert
them: that is, we should be ready to acknowledge
the Merit due to them, but cannot
deny it without the basest Injury.</p>

<p>Behold then what Justice requires of us!
Parents who teach their Children a Knowledge
of Property, who inspire them with a
Resolution never to invade it in others, who
teach them a Fairness in their Dealings, an
Exactness in paying their Debts, and a just
Detestation of the Tricks of sophisticating
Goods, particularly Drugs, Wine, Food,
and those things that often elude our Senses,
or affect our Health; who teach them to
obey the Laws of their Country, in avoiding
all clandestine Trade, all Commerce in
prohibited or contraband Goods, and make
them ashamed of such Employments as require
them to steal their Way through the
World, or skulk about in the dark; those
Parents, I say, who do this, do well: but
that is not enough; they must check, nay
conquer a babling censorious Disposition,
and create in its stead that generous Tenderness
for others that they would wish to meet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
with themselves: but above all, they must
inspire their Hearts and Lips with Justice,
and imprint on their Souls a Sense of the
Baseness of Detraction, Calumny, and Slander.</p>

<p>Before I quit this Head, I must touch on
a Species of Injustice diametrically opposite
to that we have been censuring: my Readers
will perhaps be surprized when I say it
is Silence. So much is due to the Cause of
Justice, that we cannot always be silent without
a Breach of it. Men complain, and
very justly, that true Honour is rare to be
found; yet, while this is granted, we must
observe, that false Honour reigns in it’s
stead; but my Purpose here is, to consider
how far it is an Act of Injustice.</p>

<p>When a Man sets about a lawless Enterprize,
his first Care is to engage what he
calls a Friend to second his Attempts, or at
least to promise him Secresy; but, to make
it succeed, the Party employed is to be a
Friend on both Sides: here then is a manifest
Injustice in the Silence of the third Person,
however innocent he may be otherwise.
But what is the Principle they act upon?
Honour. What! shall I betray my Friend!
has he not reposed a Confidence in me? he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
has; and I will be faithful to it. Who can
reflect on the fatal Effects of this false Friendship,
this mistaken Honour, without trembling?
Who is there, with any Knowledge
of the World, that has not seen Sorrow,
Guilt, Destruction brought on Families by
the Connivance of a Servant, the Silence of
a Brother, and the Weakness of a Sister?
What Barbarity in a favourite Maid to be
the Instrument of a young Lady’s Ruin, by
conveying a Scrub into the very Family
whose Bread she eats; or at least sees her on
the Brink of it, without speaking a Word
for her Preservation? How dreadful are those
Friendships, how preposterous that Silence,
where a young Gentleman sees his Companion,
his Fellow-Clerk, levelling at the Destruction
of an innocent Girl, and not have
the Soul to declare the guilty Design till too
late? Or, finally, where is the Sense, the
Good-Nature, or the Justice of her who sees
a Brother taking fatal Steps, about to injure
another’s Virtue, or marry a Beggar, or ruin
himself, and, as far as he has Power, his Parents
too, without once striking at the Root,
by discovering his vicious Intentions and
Practices? Who that can distinguish Right
from Wrong, but must see the Injustice of
this Silence? Parents therefore should animate
their Children with a Resolution never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
to enter into these false Friendships, never to
promise what is in it’s Nature wrong, nor
ever to promote or connive at another’s
Harm, if in their Power to redress or prevent
it. But farther, Parents, in forming
their Children’s Minds, are in many Cases
to adapt their Instructions to the Station of
Life they are expected to act in. Those of
Condition must not see their Parents injured,
especially in a Matter of any Moment, and
neglect to remove the Fault: those who are
to serve, besides Duty and Respect, owe
Justice; therefore must not only be faithful
in their own Actions, but discover any real
Injustice in those of others; and particularly
they must detest with honest Scorn the being
privy to an underhand Match. Laying
Schemes, conveying Letters, Concealments
from the Parents, or Denials where Danger
is suspected, or otherwise contributing to the
Ruin of a young Master or Lady, even tho’
they could make their own Fortune by being
in the Secret, are Actions ever to be shunned,
as they are base in their Nature, and
grossly unjust.</p>

<p>The last Source of Injustice is Revenge.
I have said before, that pure Morality teaches
us to throw a Veil over others Faults; I may
with equal Truth say, it obliges us to forgive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
Injuries. For altho’ it is a Justice due to
ourselves to maintain our Right, yet the same
Self-Justice requires us to forgive those by
whom we have been wrong’d. If we can
remove an Injury, we may, and ought; but
Revenge is not the Weapon we are to use for
that Purpose. Whatever fires our Revenge,
is apt to cloud our Reason; Men therefore
who meditate Revenge, seldom have Reason
for their Guide; and he who forsakes Reason,
is a bad Judge how far Revenge should
be carried. If we mentally survey a revengeful
Man, how melancholy is the View! What
Agitations in his Mind! what Flutterings in
his Heart! All Nature seems convulsed within
him! and, in the Midst of his Self-torture,
his only Thoughts are, whether he shall
ruin, or be ruined; murder, or be murdered!
But if we go farther, and behold this
Man in the Action he has so eagerly sought
for, or carry our Ideas to the Consequences of
it, we must tremble with Pity. His Countenance
is an Index of his Mind: what Fury
on his Brow; what Fire darts from his Eyes;
what Malice, in confused, imperfect Accents,
flows from his Lips; and what frantic Rage
possesses his Soul! Sometimes a Duel is to
repair the Injury; dreadful Situation! since
whichsoever falls, the Calamity is inexpressible.
Who can recall the Blood once spilt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
the Life once lost? who can console the
wretched Survivor, when Revenge is glutted,
and Reflection calls him back to himself?
or can the Receiver of the Challenge
draw Consolation in his future Life, from a
false Point of Honour? no, no; it is all
Delusion; and independent of the Crimes
which gave rise to it, the Deed itself is gross
Injustice. Revenge puts on many Shapes:
some seek it not in Blood, yet, with equal
Fury, hunt another to Ruin and Death by
unjust Law-suits. What Havock does this
make! How many fall from Affluence to
Want, from Splendor to a Goal, thro’ the
Inveteracy of Revenge! Not all the Concessions
of the opposite Party, not all the
Tears of his Wife, nor the impending Ruin
of his Children, can appease the Revengeful:
Savage-like, he quits not his Hold till
his Fury is glutted, till his Adversary is destroyed.
Besides these, there are many other
Species of Revenge, less obvious indeed,
but perhaps not less criminal: there are Men
whose Fury is less, but whose Malice is equal:
Men with cooler Heads, but with inveterate
Hearts. Injuries, whether fancied or
real, seize the Heart of the Revengeful, and
having once taken place, a thousand things
are machinated for Retaliation of the Offence:
every good Office ceases; ill Offices<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
take place of them; cruel to their Character
when absent; arrogant and disdainful to
their Person when present; their Reputation
torn to Pieces; false Constructions put on
their most innocent Actions; and every sinister
Means used to strip them of Fame, and
Fortune; nay even of Bread. See here the
dreadful Passion of Revenge; view the
Cruelty on one Side, the ruinous Effects on
the other. What Care then should Parents
take to banish it from their Children’s Hearts,
seeing it is the Source of Misery to themselves,
and Destruction to others! Let them
labour to stifle the first Resentments; let them
speak to their Understandings as they advance.
Youth is naturally full of Fire, and as now
their Judgment is weak, they are easily misled
by false Notions of Honour; but where Malice
is found to reside in their Hearts, it will
demand the utmost Pains to root it out: still
all should aim at effecting it. To this End,
besides checking the earliest Resentments,
let Parents paint in the liveliest Colours the
Deformity of Revenge; let them shew how
much it destroys their own inward Peace;
let them counteract the Passion by encouraging
in them Meekness, Clemency and Love;
and above all, prove to them how much
they sink beneath the Dignity of Human
Nature, how much they injure themselves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
and how unjust they are to Society in every
Action that is accompanied with Revenge;
but particularly where Life, Health, Fame,
Peace, or Property are affected by it.</p>

<p>Thus much have I said to shew the Necessity
Parents are under of teaching their
Children the Knowledge and Love of that
great Bond of Society, Justice: it demands
indeed much more Labour to discuss every
Point; but I persuade myself, that if their
Hearts are duly impressed with the Principles
here laid down, they will be animated to
know and practise every other Act of Justice
which their various Stations in Life offer
them the Occasions of. Virtues beget Virtues;
one Act of Equity will lead them to
a second; a second will warm them to the
Execution of a third; a Self-denial of little
irregular things, will make way for the Entrance
of Reason; and Reason exercised on
the solid Principles of Justice, will enable
them to conquer every lawless Desire, every
turbulent Passion.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding what has been said thro’
the Course of this Attempt, of conquering
our Passions, it is not to be understood that
we are to be passive, spiritless, and insipid;
far from it; this would be frustrating the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
Design of Providence. We are, under Reason’s
Guide, to enjoy our own Minds with
honest Freedom; and he who has a warm
Heart, a chearful Mind, and a frank Behaviour,
bids fairest for being a good Man.
But what irresistibly proves us design’d for
an active State, is, the Virtue of Fortitude.
Fortitude is Patience improv’d; it is Courage
exalted; it is that Virtue which enables
us not only to bear Sickness, Pain, Disgrace,
and Poverty, but arms us with Power either
to conquer these Evils, or at least so to weaken
their Force that they may not bear too hard
upon us. In viewing Mankind in general,
or if each views himself in particular, it
will be found that Life is imbitter’d a thousand
Ways; all have their own Troubles,
all feel their different Sufferings; some indeed
taste so little of the Sweets of Life, or
have them so strongly impregnated with
Sorrows, that they are scarce sensible
of their Relish: Fortitude alone then is the
Remedy for these Evils; and therefore should
be the Object of every one’s Study. With
this Weapon we are enabled to face every
Danger, to encounter every Trouble, and to
struggle with every Difficulty: it is the Instrument
Providence has kindly put into our
Hands; and not to use it, is the highest Ingratitude,
at the same time that it is being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
ignorant of our own Happiness. Parents
then cannot justify the Neglect of this Virtue
to their Children: and it is from this
Knowledge of Life, that I have already proposed,
in Compassion and Regard to their
future Happiness, that they familiarize them,
with all the Tenderness of good Parents, to
little Disappointments while young; that
they may be arm’d to bear greater as they
ought. All irregular Desires we should disclaim
from our Hearts; but even with regard
to those which are in their Nature innocent,
lawful, and reasonable, how often
are we disappointed! How then will Children,
as they advance, struggle with Disappointments,
if Strangers to the proper Guide,
if unacquainted with Fortitude?</p>

<p>But here I must observe, that many things
are looked upon as grievous Evils, which, if
considered in a proper Light, are no Evils at
all: and to what is this owing? certainly to
the erroneous Measures taken at setting out.
The Eagerness of Children after every new
Trifle, the Desire of engaging in whatever
is called Pleasure, and the early Passion for
Dress and Show, make them earnest to have
their Humour comply’d with. Now as many
of these things are highly improper, gratifying
their Demands must be an Error more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
or less; but this is the least Part of the Evil:
the Habit of having all they desire increases
with their Years; and without considering,
whether the Things they seek are necessary
or reasonable, they pursue their Desires, and
are wretched when disappointed. Hence
arise many of the Passions which disturb the
Oeconomy of Families, and fill the World
with Disorder: Men disappointed in their
Business, and cross’d in their Will, burst into
Rage, or contract a Fretfulness which
makes them unhappy in themselves, and
painful to all who see or feel the Effects of
it: and Women who have been used in
Childhood to conquer their Parents, and in
Youth all the World, who have been constantly
addressed in the language of Romances,
and have been vainly taught to
think the Men their Slaves; Women, I say,
who are thus educated, are but very ill prepared
to meet Disappointments: the first
Opposition throws them into Fits, whence
follow Vapours, Melancholy and Indolence;
the next kindles their Resentment, which
agitates the Mind, spoils the Features, by
tearing off the natural Softness of the Countenance,
and puts the sweetest Temper into
a Ferment; and, if a Husband be the Object
of it, ’tis great Odds but a short Time
creates either an unjust Coldness, or a fixed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
Aversion. Mr. <i>Locke</i>, sensible of the Danger
of irregular Indulgence, thus describes
the Situation of a fondled Son. “He that
hath been used to have his Will in every
thing as long as he was in Coats, why
should we think it strange that he should
desire it, and contend for it still, when he
is in Breeches? Indeed, as he grows towards
a Man, Age shews his Faults the
more; so that there are few Parents then
so blind as not to see them, few so insensible
as not to feel the ill Effects of their
own Indulgence. He had the Will of
his Maid before he could speak or go;
he had the Mastery of his Parents ever
since he could prattle; and why, now he
is grown up, is stronger and wiser than he
was then, why now of a sudden should
he be restrained and curbed? Why must
he at seven, fourteen, or twenty Years
old, lose the Privilege, which his Parents
Indulgence till then so largely allowed
him?” From all this it is evident, that
the early planting of regular Desires, checking
the Growth of vicious ones, and subjecting
Passion to Reason, are the great
Means to lay the Foundation of Happiness
in our Children, and the surest Fence against
many Evils they would otherwise be exposed
to: but if after all this, Sorrow, Pain, Disappointment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
or Poverty be their Lot, let
Parents teach them to meet it as they ought;
teach them with the firmest Resolution, with
unshaken Constancy, to bear up against the
rude Attack; and teach them that the only
way to lessen the Evils they cannot avoid, is
to adhere inseparably to that heroic Virtue
Fortitude.</p>

<p>I am now led to speak of Temperance;
the calmest Companion of the Heart of Man.
Temperance is the Virtue that bridles our irregular
Desires; it is nearly ally’d to Prudence,
and has a close Connection with Justice;
it calms Revenge, and quenches the
Fire of unjust Resentment; it checks the
Epicure, and stops the riotous Hand of the
Bacchanalian; it extinguishes or abates the
Flames of Lust, and banishes every lawless
Action; it silences the flippant detracting
Tongue, and gives in it’s stead a pleasing
Moderation of Speech; it shuts the Door
against Avarice, and proves experimentally,
that Happiness does not consist in the eager
Pursuit or Acquisition of Riches, but in
a contented Mind; it curbs that strongest
of all other Passions, Gaming, and distinguishes
justly the Absurdity and Folly of
making that a dangerous Trade, which was
only designed as a Relaxation and an Amusement:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
Temperance, in a word, is the Parent
of many Virtues; the Parent of Peace,
Prosperity, Health and Joy. But while
these are Truths acknowledged and received,
how comes it that we know so little of the
Practice of them? How comes it that in
general these are mere Matters of Speculation?
Alas! the Spring is tainted in the
Source. We are intemperate in our very
Cradles; no wonder therefore if we remain
so our whole Lives. We are born with irregular
Appetites; and which, thro’ Errors
in Judgment, or mistaken Fondness, are
daily rendered still more so. But let us leave
these melancholy Reflections, and consider
the Advantages we enjoy, the Privileges we
are invested with. Providence, kind Providence,
has given us Reason for our Guide;
and Reason will conduct us to Temperance.—Nothing
can be more strange to all Observation,
than the Practice of forsaking Temperance;
since every Day’s Experience proves
to us, that Intemperance produces the very
opposite to what we seek. Suppose when a
Child is born, we ask the Parents what it is
they wish in that Child; they will answer,
Life. But as Life alone, that is, mere Existence,
may by Infirmity or other Accidents
be very wretched, they will naturally wish for
Health and Happiness. Well then, Life,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
Health, and Happiness, are the general Wishes
of Parents for their Children. Now let us
see how their Wishes are likely to succeed.
Their first Step is usually a shameful Neglect
of the Food of Nature, the Breast;
the next, a blind Gratification of their Will;
the third, an almost total Neglect of their
Manners; and a fourth, the cherishing in
them every irregular Affection. Where then
is the Wonder that Parents are disappointed?
Life and Health depend on proper Food and
other judicious Management on one part;
and if sick, an Obedience to Remedies on
the other part; and Happiness essentially depends
in the first place on Health; in the
next, on the due Government of our Senses,
Affections and Passions. See here how Mankind
deviate from themselves; how far they
depart from their own Principles. But what
then is the Remedy? nothing more obvious.
Let Parents exercise their Reason in all the
Steps they take for their Children’s Welfare;
let them examine Right and Wrong; let
them not only avoid Passion, but labour to
correct their own Errors of Judgment, that
they may be the better enabled to prevent
them in their Children; but particularly, let
them fix in them the Knowledge, Love, and
Habit of Temperance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>These Rules will doubtless be an Infringement
on those Liberties Parents usually take
in indulging their Children’s Stomachs; and
it will be a greater in the Restraint it lays on
their growing Passions: but they must convince
them of the Purity of their Intentions
by speaking to their Understandings; not all
at once, but by Degrees, as they open and
gain Strength; so that Step by Step they
may point out to them the Loveliness, the
Pleasure, and the Advantages of this uncommon
Virtue. I say nothing here of the State
of Childhood, because it is already understood
that Parents have their Children’s Health regulated
by proper Management, and their
Minds docile thro’ the Force of Obedience;
but when Dress, Pleasure, Company, Feasting,
or whatever subjects us to be intemperate,
come into Play, as they are Actions
which always cause a Struggle, more or less,
between Passion and Reason, it demands the
greatest Care and Attention of Parents to
win them to a Love of Temperance.</p>

<p>An easy Submission to our Lot in Life is
one of the greatest Attainments towards Happiness.
View a young Lady with a strong
Passion for Dress; every new thing strikes
her; one Companion has a richer Silk than
herself; another has the sweetest Lace she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
ever saw; a third has Ear-rings ten times
handsomer than her own; she burns with
Impatience to equal them, and that granted,
new things arise, and the others are old tho’
not worn out; that is, her Relish for them
is lost. Thus a continual round of Fashions
keep her incessantly anxious; and tho’ perhaps
she possesses every thing, she enjoys
nothing. Not so the calmer well-instructed
Fair; she considers that Propriety of Dress
is what suits her Station; and covets not
another’s Jewels: she wears, without a Blush,
a meaner Silk than her meaner Companion;
and free from the Extremes of Negligence
or Pride, she is qualify’d for all the Dignity
that Dress can give her; but is equally happy
in an inferior Appearance. Thus too it
happens with our Sons: One is in the continual
Pursuit of Pleasure, has a thousand
Contrivances to reach a Play, a Ball, or a
Horse-race; and is miserable if these things
are going on without him: while another,
awaken’d by Reason, and check’d by Temperance,
takes these things as they come;
and neither insipidly refuses the Chearfulness
of an Entertainment, nor is disturb’d of his
Rest, or loses either his Temper or his Appetite,
if he is disappointed. Such is the
Difference between Passion and Reason, such
the genuine Effects of Temperance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>Temperance, as I observ’d before, is
closely connected with Justice; that is,
whatever thro’ Intemperance affects our
Health, or endangers our Lives, must be
unjust. What can be more amazing than
the false Judgment of Mankind even in the
most obvious things! All allow that we
have no Right voluntarily to throw away
that Life which Providence has given us;
on the contrary, we are bound to support it,
even under the Pressure of Pain and Sorrow,
to the last Moment. How comes it
then that while this is acknowledged, while
Men justly shrink with Horror at the very
Thought of Self-murder, they have the
Hardiness to dally with some murderous Instrument?
All the Arguments that are
brought against Suicide, whether by Sword,
Pistol, Laudanum, or Arsenic, hold good,
in some Degree, in the Point before us. The
oftener a Building is shock’d, the sooner will
it decay; the more Violence is us’d to a delicate
Machine, the sooner will it be destroy’d;
and no Machine is so exquisitely
delicate as Man. Now as every Species of
Excess, Riot, and Debauchery, is a Shock
given to our Frame, it must naturally impair
our Health, and consequently shorten
our Lives. Many things tend to effect this,
that Men in general are Strangers to; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
there are others they are too sensible of, yet
attempt not to remove, nay plunge themselves
into. Here then appears the Necessity
of Temperance; here we see the great Obligation
of Parents to their Children in this
Point: since they are not only accountable
for their Happiness, but even for their
Health and Lives. To conclude, let Parents
in inculcating this Virtue dissuade their
Children from every irregular Attachment,
and convince them that no intemperate Affections
are justifiable; that besides avoiding
those irregular Passions which may be said
to reside in the Soul, there are others that
dwell on the Senses, equally capable of destroying
us; particularly an unhappy Attachment
to sleeping, eating, drinking, and
many other things in their Nature not
only innocent but indispensably necessary;
yet, by the frequent grievous Abuse of them,
made the Instruments of our Destruction.</p>

<p>These are the things I had to offer on the
Part of Manners; these are the Steps I have
already in great measure taken with my
own Children, and these the Sentiments I
wish to inspire them with. If therefore, as
general Laws, they are equally applicable to
others, my presenting them in Print will, I
hope, be consider’d with the same Candour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
they are offered. But notwithstanding what
has already been said, Parents have still
much to do. To keep up the Spirit of
Government, they must constantly remember
that Nature and Reason are to be their
Guides: if we distort Nature, our Children
will be preposterous Figures; and if we banish
Reason, they will be Brutes or Monsters.
Parents must remember too, that it
is not for themselves that they labour to train
up their Children in Order, Obedience, and
Knowledge; there must be no self-pointed
Views, no Pride, no Dispositions to tyrannise
over their own Flesh and Blood; these
are Motives unworthy a Place in any Parent’s
Breast. Their principal Aim must be
to make their Children happy, by making
them wise and good; and if they succeed
herein, so much Happiness will be reflected
back on themselves as will amply reward all
their Labours. But they must not stop even
here; tho’ this Design is noble, they should
have a nobler yet in view; that is, the universal
Good of Mankind: ’tis too narrow a
Good that seeks itself alone; Children must
therefore be animated by their Parents with
all those Virtues that will make them dear
and valuable to Society. Now what Chance
is there that Children will come on the Stage
of Life with the necessary Requisites, unless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
due Pains are taken to mould and temper their
Hearts, to form their Minds, and cultivate
their Understandings? Mr. <i>Pope</i>, after labouring
to prove for what End we are in being,
what Good we are to pursue, and what
Evil avoid, concludes, “that all our
Knowledge is ourselves to know.” If
then this Self-knowledge is of such vast Importance
for the securing our Happiness even
in a moral Sense, and is so very difficult to
be attained; surely Parents are under the
highest Obligation to their Children of improving
every Means within their Reach,
for the gaining this only true Philosopher’s
Stone. The End, as Philosophers agree,
is the first thing in the Intention; but the
Means to attain that End are surely, in the
Case before us, either but little known, or
little practised; else we should not see such
daily and grievous Mistakes committed in
the training up our little Offspring; nor
such a continued Chain of Vice, Folly, and
Ignorance, as is the general Result of this
mistaken Manners, this want of Self-knowledge.</p>

<p>But here I must caution my Readers not
to bewilder themselves in a Maze of fancied
Difficulties; not to throw aside these Instructions
as useful or practicable to none but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
those of Genius, Learning, and great Abilities:
the Light of Nature and Reason
beams strongly on us all; and Parents, as
I have before observed, have it greatly in
their Power to regulate their Children’s Conduct:
for after all, it must be confessed,
that it is not so much that Parents do not
know, as that they want the Will, to act
rightly. But I hope, that such as are really
ignorant, will here, in some measure, be
informed; such as already know, will here
be induced to practise: since by avoiding
the Errors too generally run into, so much
solid Good will ensue. But, to return back
again: where or how are we to begin?
Why—(as has already been advanc’d) by
Authority. Authority is undoubtedly the
first Means towards attaining this great
End; the other Means are, a steady Attention
to the various Tempers of our Children;
a strict Guard over our own Conduct;
a watchful Eye on theirs; joined to
a serious Practice of every Lesson for their
Improvement: to which we are to add, such
an Education as is suitable to our Sphere in
Life.</p>

<h2>EDUCATION.</h2>

<p>Education is a very extensive
Subject; it is a vast Field to expatiate
in; and has employed the Thoughts and
Pens of many great Men, with whom I pretend
not to vie: I confess myself far unequal
to the Task; and perhaps the greatest Service
I can do my Readers, is to inform them,
that, besides the ancient Writers, the Archbishop
of <i>Cambray</i>, <i>Tanaquil Faber</i>, Mr. <i>Locke</i>,
Monsieur <i>Crousaz</i>, and Monsieur <i>Rollin</i>, with
some others still later, have handled this important
Subject. To these then I refer them,
as great and useful Guides; but not to these
alone; they must go farther; and apply to
those, whose Province it is to reduce the
Theory of these to Practice: such are many
of our living Guides; who tho’ they have
not perhaps distinguished themselves by their
Writings, are notwithstanding deservedly
eminent for their Skill in teaching.</p>

<p>Nor is Education what I principally engaged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
in, in this Treatise; Manners alone,
I have declared to be my Design; and if I
can do the present or future Age any real
Service by the Plan of puerile Government
already laid down, I shall be happy in considering
myself as a useful Member of Society.
Still it will appear that Education
and Manners have so great a Connection,
that they are not always to be separated:
many of the Writers on these Subjects have
considered them as one and the same thing;
many just Sentiments are imbibed at the same
time that we are acquiring Languages, and
other Parts of Learning: and notwithstanding
a Truth which was advanced at our first
setting out, that much Manners might be
acquired without School-learning, yet it is
not to be doubted that they ought to rise in
proportion to the Education bestowed on us.
Two things therefore I aim at in pursuing
this Subject, without attempting to teach,
or invading the Province of the Preceptor;
the one, to point out what seems necessary for
both Boys and Girls, in different Spheres of
Life, to learn or avoid; the other, to shew
how far the Education bestowed on them is
applicable to the Improvement of their Manners;
or to their Engagement in any Art,
Profession, or Science.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>As entering on the Subject of Education
will naturally carry the Ideas of Parents back
to the Childhood of their Offspring, I will,
in Conformity with that, suppose, that the
Rules already laid down chiefly regard the
first Stage of Life; at most, that they are
the Ground-work of a future Superstructure:
this granted, I will suppose too, that
Parents have employed these first seven
Years in moulding their Children, and rendering
them so far pliable, as readily to submit
to whatever their Parents think proper
for them to engage in. There is a strong
Passion in many Parents to have their Children
forward and early in their Learning;
where there is really a Genius, a very great
Propensity and Aptness to learn, this may
certainly not only be allowed, but improved;
yet in general I think very little Account
is to be made of what they can learn
before seven Years old: it is commonly
Rote-work, and often forgot almost as soon
as learned. However, let these things be
taken as they are found: if a Child has a
great Quickness and Facility in learning,
let it by no Means be check’d; on the other
hand, let not another be severely chastised,
or it’s Life rendered miserable, who has not
the same early Aptness. Those who would
avoid Error on this Point must consider,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
that a Child’s Memory and Judgment are
yet too weak to be much exercised; that
close Application and intense Labour are
very unfit for this Infant Age; that it is
putting their tender Minds too much upon
the Stretch; and endangers either a fix’d
Aversion to learn, or an incurable Dulness:
let them farther consider, that such a quick
Child as I have been speaking of, learns
without the least Difficulty; and if they
oblige one of another Cast to learn as much
in the same time, it is odds but they
give him more Pain than his Frame can
bear. Parents then must be very careful to
avoid these first Mistakes in the educating
their Children; since from a natural Fondness
to have them appear to Advantage,
they often thrust them on things that are unsuitable
to their Age, and such as they are
by no Means qualified to undertake.</p>

<p>It must not here be understood, that nothing
is to be attempted in the first Stage of
Life; that would be the opposite Extreme
of Error; and playful as Children usually
are at that Age, the leaving them wholly to
themselves for seven Years would be not
only injuring their Capacities, but might endanger
a Habit of Idleness: what I mean
is, that all which relates to Education should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
now be made as light, as easy, and as pleasant
as possible; that, as I have observed
before, Parents should take things as they
are, and not be dissatisfied or disappointed,
if they find no extraordinary Progress
made.</p>

<p>But this first Stage being over, the Business
becomes serious; they are now to enter
the Schools. Parents of almost every
Rank aim, or seem to aim, at giving their
Children Learning; ’tis a natural Ambition,
and, if rationally used, highly laudable.
Those of an inferior Class say, with
a significant Shake of the Head, ’Tis a fine
thing to be a Scholar! True, it is so: but
surely it is a sad thing to be a learned Beggar;
and worse yet to be a learned Blockhead:
an unlearned Cobler is a Prince to
either of these. To judge of the Propriety
of Education, we should, I think, argue
from a Knowledge of Life; for as no one
surely will say that the same Degree of it is
equally proper for all, it follows of course
that it will be right or wrong, in proportion
to our Knowledge or Ignorance of Mankind,
and of those Stations wherein it is so
variously exercised. Now in viewing it in
this judicious Light, it appears to me, that
the Steps frequently taken by Parents in the
educating their Children, are in many respects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
erroneous. Nor is this by any means
to be ascribed to the Teachers, but to the
Parents; not to the Plan, but to the Execution:
for as in the Order of Nature, every
thing has it’s own Sphere, it’s Province assign’d
it, which cannot be departed from
without Error; so in the various Degrees of
Mankind, if a proper Regard be not had to
Situation and Abilities, the Mistakes committed
in educating our Children must be
very many.</p>

<p>At the same time that I venture to think
our Notions of Education sometimes erroneous,
I confess it is extremely difficult to fix
precise Rules for a better; no wonder therefore
if I err in the Attempt; and in that
Case, I hope, the Goodness of my Intention
will plead my Excuse. But here let me ask
a natural Question; What is it all Mankind
aim at in the Education of their Children?
certainly to give them such a Degree of
Knowledge as will qualify them to fill some
certain Post, some certain Station in Life:
in short, to fit them for an Employment
suited to their Condition, such as will make
them happy in themselves, and useful to Society.
This, I say, is, or ought to be our
Aim: but how grievously do we pervert it?
Parents often mistakenly soar above their
Reach; like Adventurers in a Lottery, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
gape for the highest Prizes; all ambitiously
strive to make their Children something more
than common, something above themselves;
and by these Means often, very often, overturn
and utterly ruin them.</p>

<p>The principal Aim of Parents should be,
to know what Sphere of Life their Children
will act in; what Education is really suitable
for them; what will be the Consequence
of neglecting that; and what Chance
a superior Education will give them for
their Advancement to Posts of Dignity. I
grant, it is Pity that a fine Genius should be
uncultivated and buried in Oblivion; but
surely it is greater Pity that Parents should
so generally mistake their Children’s Station,
Genius, Capacity, and Inclinations,
as they generally do; nay more, mistake
their own Capacity too; by engaging them
in things above their Ability to conduct
them through. The first thing many Parents
do, is, blindly to magnify their Children’s
Parts; in consequence whereof they
engage them in such Studies as square with
their Fancy; they then turn their Eyes on
some few great Men, whose uncommon
Merit, Genius, or Good-fortune, have rais’d
them to conspicuous Stations; and thus, in
the Vanity of their Hearts, conclude their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
Sons are to be Judges, Bishops, Generals,
and I know not what. But I would here
earnestly dissuade Parents from this capital
Mistake; indeed it seems so glaringly absurd,
that I am surprized it should be so
common. But those in inferior Stations will
say, May we not then give our Children
Education? yes certainly: but it should be
a suitable one. What then, may we not aspire
to raise our Children in the World? or
must they, from Generation to Generation,
remain Mechanics, Tradesmen, or the like?
Let me not be misunderstood. Every one
should look forward; there is a necessary
Degree of Spirit becoming all Mankind;
but then to be judicious, it must be rational:
thus, at the same time that we avoid
sinking into Meanness, we must be very
careful not to tower so high as to endanger
our dashing down into Error.</p>

<p>Education, tho’ design’d to lead us to
every Advantage, is often bestowed to our
Disadvantage, by being the Cause of many
Errors, we should otherwise have escaped.
Education is often wasted on us,
either by being improper for our Station, or
by engaging us in things we are unfit for.
Education is a Term that often misleads Parents
themselves; for many do not know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
either it’s Extent or Use, nor know if their
Children possess it or not. These things
considered, it is easy to conclude how common
an erroneous Education must be; and
how much it behoves Parents to reflect on
the necessary Means to obviate the like Errors
for the future.</p>

<p>I remember a Lady whose Coachman was
an Instance of the Mistakes I have been
speaking of. I am resolved, says he to
some of his Acquaintance, to have one
Gentleman in my Family at least. In order
thereto, he gave his Son Education, and
then put him to an Attorney: this entitled
the young Fellow to dress out, and keep,
what he call’d, good Company; these led
him to Pleasures, Gallantry, and many
other Extravagancies; in fine, the old Man
broke his Heart; and the young one in a
short time was utterly ruined. But how
much happier would he probably have been,
had he kept to his proper Sphere, and been a
Coachman too! It frequently happens, that
honest industrious Men among the common
Trades, as well as others, grow wealthy,
and consequently are ambitious of giving
their Children Learning; now as these People
have usually but a very small Share
themselves, they know little more of it than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
the Name: they send a Boy to School, and
because they hear him speak hard Words,
and see him hammering at a Latin Exercise,
sagely conclude that he has Learning;
when it is fifty to one, that, comparatively
speaking, he knows nothing. It requires a
great deal of Time, Diligence, and Application
for a Boy to become a good Grammarian,
tho’ taught by the best Methods
and the best Masters; what then must be
the Fate of those who are under bad Teachers?
and that there are some such, I believe
will not be disputed. But supposing a
Boy really acquires some Knowledge; let us
see of what Use it will be to him: his Father
is perhaps a Baker, and it is convenient
to him to bring his Son up to his own
Business; what does a Baker want with
Latin? nothing. Besides, continued Disuse
will make him forget it; or, should he
retain it, of what Use could it be to him,
but to make him pedantic and self-conceited?
But perhaps upon the Presumption that this
Boy is a Scholar, the honest Baker, desirous
that his Son should cut a Figure, sends him
to the University, and he becomes a Divine:
but what Pity is it that a good Baker
should be spoiled? The innocent young
Man, tho’ spirited up by his fond mistaken
Parents, has perhaps no Talents, no Genius,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
no Interest; what then must be his
Fate? why—he must drudge, and court,
and wait his whole Life, and at last gain
nothing. What can be more mistaken than
this Conduct, and yet what more common?
It may be urged, that these are Instances of
illiterate Parents only, and that People in
better Life know better things: now allowing
that to be the Case, still as Parents of
this Kind are very numerous, they stand in
great need of being set right, as the Errors
they commit by this false Education are
productive of many Evils.</p>

<p>Every Nation has it’s Custom of dividing
the People into Classes. The <i>Police</i> of
<i>France</i> divide them into Quality, Noblesse,
Artificers, and Peasantry. <i>England</i>, a mix’d
Government, and a trading Nation, have
the Nobility, Gentry, Mercantile or Commercial
People, Mechanics, and Peasantry.
Were we to subdivide the People, we might
run it to an Infinity: to avoid Confusion
therefore, I will select five Classes; <i>viz.</i> the
Nobility, the Gentry, the genteel Trades,
all those particularly which require large Capitals,
the common Trades, and the Peasantry.
But tho’ for the Sake of Perspicuity
and Brevity, I confine my Observations to
these, yet they may occasionally be applied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
to others; and tho’ <i>London</i> may in general
be called the Scene of Action thro’ my whole
Design, yet is it equally applicable to, and
intended for, the Benefit of the whole Kingdom.</p>

<p>Persons of Rank and Quality are, I doubt,
placed in too high a Sphere for any Instructions
of mine to reach them; or should this
Attempt fall into their Hands, what Chance
is there for it’s being useful to them, since
they seem to have every Advantage, every
Help at command. Still as true Wisdom
consists in seeking Instruction wherever it can
be found, and as the lowest among Mankind
may drop a Hint that may be useful to the
highest, I will, with all due Deference and
Respect, venture to speak my Thoughts;
and if they reach the Ears of the Great, I
dare hope, they will at least commend the
Design, if they cannot applaud the Execution.</p>

<p>Human Nature (as daily Experience
shews us) is, in the general, alike in all,
from the Prince to the Peasant: the same
Weaknesses attend us; the same Passions
torment us; the same Diseases kill us: all
are the Work of <span class="smcap">one great Artist</span>! all
are born for the same great End! The Gifts
of Fortune indeed are innumerably different;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
the Advantages of Education very
many; and as a Train of Vices corrupts our
Manners, so a Succession of Virtues may be
said to enoble our Birth and purify our
Blood. Hence it is we often see those exalted
Virtues in the Great and Noble inherited
by their Posterity; and hence too we
often discover, even where Pains are taken
to conceal it, an inbred Dignity, a Mein
and Aspect superior to the Generality of
Men. Still this Rule is by no Means universal;
for the same Experience shews us,
that great Men can do little things; even
such as the private and obscure would be
ashamed of. And how so? because Passion,
not Reason, is their Guide. Parents
then, we see, even of the highest Rank, are
under an indispensable Obligation of regulating
the Manners of their Children. Philosophers
say, that all Passions are in all
Men; but that their Predominance is unequal,
and different in different Men: if so,
the Great stand in most need of having them
subdued, or at least regulated, as the Power
to indulge them is greater in them than in
others. But granting that Parents of Quality
are convinced of these Truths, and take
all the Steps already recommended for training
up their Children in proper Decorum;
granting too, that they design every thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
for their real Advantage; they have still
many things both to do and avoid which are
not common to all.</p>

<p>Their first Care must be to avoid Sycophants,
Flatterers, and Hypocrites; they
are but too constant Attendants on the
Great, and their Business is to diffuse an imperceptible
Poison (if I may be allowed the
Metaphor) over both Parents and Children.
Nothing is so amiable as Truth, nothing
more desirable, and yet nothing more difficult
to reach the Great. If a Nobleman has
a Child whose Parts are weak, whose Genius
is slow and shallow, it is undoubtedly a
Misfortune, but cannot be his Fault: the
natural Blindness of Parents keeps them
from seeing these Defects so clearly as another;
but the unnatural, at least unmanly
Artifices of the Flatterer totally prevent
their seeing them at all: and thus the noble
Heir is mistakenly taught to think himself
what Nature has forbid he shall ever be.</p>

<p>Another Care is, that Youth of Quality,
who have Parts and Quickness, be not suffered
to waste the first Flower of their Age
in Idleness: it is a grievous Error, yet very
common. I have already observed, that
Parents who know nothing are injudiciously,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
and even anxiously solicitous to have their
Children Scholars; and by a strange reverse
Infatuation, Parents of Rank are often very
indifferent about it. This Error is undoubtedly
sometimes owing to themselves only by
a supine Negligence in their own natural
Temper; but it is much oftener owing to
the false Praises given by those that have
both the Parents and the Child’s Ear. A
young Heir soon knows the Title, Dignity
and Estate he is born to possess; too soon
does he know his Independence, and too apt
is he to grow careless about his Learning on
this very Account, but if to these Impediments
be added imaginary Excellence and
Knowledge, thro’ the daily Flattery of a
Dependent, what is likely to be the Consequence?
why, that he will remain ignorant
his whole Life. For who will take Pains to
learn, that is firmly persuaded he knows
enough already? and that many of our young
Noblemen are trained up in this Disposition,
nobody, I believe, will deny: it is true that
Time may convince them of their Error;
but it will then perhaps be too late to recover
what they have lost.</p>

<p>The Education of a Nobleman should contain
every thing that is both useful and ornamental.
As he is more conspicuous than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
others, as he always stands on an Eminence,
his Education should be such as may reflect
a Lustre on every one that beholds him.
He is to be considered as a Pillar of the
Laws, an Honour and an Ornament to the
Age he lives in. To this End he is to study
first, Languages; that is to say, two of the
dead ones, <i>viz.</i> <i>Latin</i> and <i>Greek</i>; and of
the living ones, besides his Mother-tongue,
<i>French</i> at least. The Learned disagree very
much as to the Variety of Languages necessary
to be acquired; some are of Opinion,
that besides these already named, <i>Italian</i>,
<i>Spanish</i>, <i>Portuguese</i>, and more yet, are becoming
the Education of a great Man; and
urge in their Favour, that the more Languages
are gained, the more the Mind is enlarged:
others dissent from this, and maintain,
that a great Variety rather confuses the
Mind than otherwise; that <i>Latin</i> and <i>Greek</i>
are indisputably the Languages of all learned
Men; after those, <i>French</i>, and at most <i>Italian</i>,
are all that need be added, as every thing
may be found in these, either originally or
translated into them: but they farther argue,
that it is a great Waste of Time, spent merely
in the Acquisition of Languages, when so
many nobler Studies are to be pursued; Studies
which at once strike the Mind, and
constitute true Science. This last Reasoning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
has, I think, great Force; but here for a
Moment let me leave the Nobleman, to make
an Observation on general Life. Languages,
besides being considered as general Parts of
Education, are particularly necessary in certain
Circumstances of Life. If one, whether
for Education or Business, goes to reside
in <i>Holland</i>, <i>France</i>, <i>Spain</i>, or <i>Italy</i>, it would
be an Absurdity not to attain the Language
of the Country; so if another is to be a Merchant,
surely he should not be a Stranger to
the Language of his Correspondents; thus
are these, and many other things more or
less necessary, just as they are circumstanced:
and therefore should Parents, besides the
Education they bestow on their Children, as
suited to their Station in general, join to it
that which is necessary in particular. But,
to return;</p>

<p>Besides Languages, a Nobleman is to
learn Philosophy, both Moral and Natural;
Mathematics; the ancient and modern
Laws of our own Country; and the Customs,
Laws and Manners of other Nations.
He should particularly be a Critic in our
own History, and our own Language; because
they are what in real Life he will have
most occasion to exercise. To this solid
Learning should be added the Embellishments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
of polite Literature, Poetry, Painting,
and Music; and to compleat the Character,
Dancing, Fencing, Riding and Architecture.
Tho’ this is going a considerable Way, it is
much the least Part of what ought reasonably
to be expected from him, considering
the Light he stands in. It is of great Consequence
that his Preceptor have a good
Head; but it is of much more that he has
an honest Heart. He is to humanize his
Pupil’s Soul, and form him for all those
Actions that will give him a real, not a fancied
Dignity. He should raise in him an
ardent Love of his own Country; but, as
every other Nation has it’s Virtues as well as
Vices, he should at the same time avoid the
customary Prejudice of allowing them nothing.
While he is taught to think and act
nobly, he should be informed that the Knowledge,
the Care and the Improvement of his
Estate, are essential Obligations, and such
as cannot be dispensed with. He must be
easy of Access, without which Truth will
seldom reach his Ear; nor will he be able to
distinguish Merit from Demerit; or know
how to right the Injured, or punish the Injurer.
While he maintains his Dignity, he
must be ready to condescend to Inferiors with
an humble Deportment where necessary; and
be taught to see and feel another’s Woe:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
which nothing will more inforce, than convincing
him of the Instability of all human
Grandeur. His Dress and Behaviour should
be like his Quality, noble; yet perfectly free
from Affectation, Vanity and Pride. He
must be taught to know, that ’tis not for
himself alone he is to live, but, from the
politest Manners, a wise Conduct, and a benevolent
Heart, to diffuse Pleasure and Joy
to all that know him. Vice and Virtue are
to be placed before him in their genuine
Light; and the Beauty of the one made a
Contrast to the Deformity of the other.
While he is taught to distinguish Honour
from Infamy, Nobility from Meanness, the
utmost Care should be taken to shew him
how much he would sink beneath a Man,
should he become a Slave to any irregular
Passion. He should, for Example sake, as
well as his own, be instructed to shun every
thing that is mean, base or vicious; and, in
a word, be endowed with all those Virtues
that will make him generous, noble, wise,
and good. Much more might be said on
this Occasion, much more might be added;
but as the Great are supplied with far abler
Helps from other Hands, I will only add on
this Head, that if the Admonitions here
offered be reduced to Practice, every other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
Virtue, even the most heroic, will become
familiar and easy.</p>

<p>My next Topic is the Education of a
young Lady of the first Quality; from
which, if the Course of my Design did not
make it necessary, I would gladly be excused:
for as the most delicate Flowers require
the tenderest Treatment, so the conducting
a Woman of Quality thro’ the first
Stages, and ushering her into the World,
is of all others the nicest Part to act. Still, as
Nature and Reason are my Guides; by them
I hope to be enabled to offer some Aid,
however small, for the promoting this great
End.</p>

<p>As all Parents have a Right to exercise a
proper Authority, so all Children, however
high their Rank, should be taught to obey.
Great Spirits may think Obedience mean;
but Parents are to remember their Children’s
Happiness is at stake: without Obedience
they cannot regulate their Passions: and if
not regulated, they have but little Chance
for Happiness. Misfortunes with a Coronet,
Misfortunes with a Coach and Six, are still
Misfortunes; and it is the Business of every
Parent so to conduct their Children, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
they may on their part avoid them, or so to
fortify them that they may bear them as
they ought. But, as it is most agreeable to
good Sense, I will conclude that Parents of
the highest Rank are convinced of this, and
have employed the Infant Age of their Children
accordingly. What next is to be done?
What Education is most proper for a young
Lady of the first Quality? Such surely as
will distinguish her from the Crowd; such
as will more adorn her Mind, than the Jewels
she wears adorn her Person.</p>

<p>The Errors committed in the Education
of the Children of private Persons are many,
from the Parents educating them above their
Rank; still there is one general Excuse may
be made for them, which is, that as the
Turns of Fortune are sometimes very great,
they don’t know what Occasion they may
have for it. But in Persons of Quality the
Case is different; they are already at the
Summit, and their Education should suit
their Rank. As soon therefore as the first
Stage is over, (not to mention what she may
have learnt during that Period) a young
Lady’s Time is to be esteemed precious:
Reading, Writing, Working, Dancing,
<i>French</i>, <i>Italian</i> and Music are all to be taught
her; and that not superficially, as is too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
much the Custom; not so as to puzzle and
confound her Understanding, but to enlarge
and improve it. A certain Author says,
that there is not a Man in a thousand who
reads well; if so, and Men assert a Superiority
of Knowledge, it will be no unfair
Conclusion to say, there is not a Woman in
two thousand that does: but I hope this
Gentleman’s Assertion is not true, and then
the Conclusion falls of course. Still it is
very certain, that much more is required to
read our Mother-Tongue well, than is commonly
imagined; and as that is really graceful,
a young Lady should be taught to set
a great Value on it. To know the Words
and their Meaning is not sufficient; she must
know the Pointing, the Emphasis and the
Cadence; and she must know too, how, in
different Parts, and on different Subjects, to
modify her Voice, or she will never read well.
To read with Energy and Beauty, we should
know our Subject; and here the Understanding
is concerned; this gain’d, we have
nothing more to do but to keep close to Nature;
for the greatest Fault committed in
reading is, the throwing ourselves out of Nature.
As I have formerly attended the Lectures
of several public Professors, I remember
one who committed this Fault of throwing
himself out of Nature, as I have just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
observed; when he read, he put on a Tone
of Voice not his own; when he laid down
his Paper to explain what he had been reading,
he was himself again; and thus was he
in and out of himself, if I may be allowed
the Expression, ten times in an Hour. And
yet this was a Man of Letters, a Man of
Science, a Philosopher!</p>

<p>The Hand-writing of a young Lady should
have an easy Elegance in it; a Medium between
the <i>Italian</i>, which tho’ beautiful to see
is usually wrote very slowly, and that Meanness
of Hand too common in the Sex. Either
of these Faults in a Lady’s Hand-writing
will appear in their true Light, if we consider
that the Custom of writing familiar
Epistles is one of the most important Steps
in her Education. Nothing tends more to
open the Mind, nothing bids fairer for gaining
a Knowledge of the World, next to the
seeing it, than the giving and receiving one
another’s Thoughts with Freedom, in a virtuous
Intercourse of friendly Epistles. Now
an evident Obstacle to this is the Manner of
Writing; if a young Lady’s Hand is a fine
<i>Italian</i>, she hates the Thoughts of writing a
Letter, because it will take up so much Time;
and if it be a bad Hand, she says her Scrawl
is so frightful, she is asham’d that any body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
should see it. But there is another important
Reason for familiarizing a young Lady
to her Pen, which is that of writing correctly.
For a fine Lady not to spell with exact Propriety,
is frightful beyond Expression; but
when she has gained that, she possesses nothing
till she writes with Grammar, with Stile, and
a suitable Turn of Expression. Some, it is
true, have by Nature a happier Turn this
way than others, and may be said to be born
with a Talent for Writing; but tho’ this be
granted, yet certainly a great deal may be
obtained by a due Care of their Education
in this Point.</p>

<p>Needle-work is by no means below the
Dignity of a Woman of Quality, therefore
she should certainly be taught it; for tho’ it
may not be called a thing she wants, yet the
very Change of Employment is often a
Pleasure: besides that the knowing it is really
useful. I have seen a Woman of Quality
at her sick Lord’s Bed-side, so far from being
ashamed to own she could use a Needle, that
what things of that kind were wanted during
the Course of his Illness she would let
nobody do for him but herself; and thus at
the same time that her Tenderness and Concern
proved the Sincerity of her Affection,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
she proved that it was not below her Quality
to be notable too.</p>

<p>Dancing I mention in course, tho’ it is
needless to recommend it here, not only because
I have elsewhere done justice to this
Part of Education, but because all are convinced
of it’s Importance, as an Accomplishment
which strikes the Beholder’s Eye,
and gives more or less favourable Impressions
in proportion as we excel in it. But
here, to avoid Error, the End of Dancing
should be remembered; that it is not so
much for the sake of shining at a Ball (tho’
that too may sometimes be necessary) but
to give an easy Air and Grace to all the Motions
of the Body.</p>

<p><i>French</i>, in it’s Purity and Perfection, is
a great Ornament to a Lady’s Education;
but that is not all: it is not only polite, but
highly useful; both as she may have frequent
Occasions to speak it, and as there
are many good Authors in that Language
not yet translated into ours.</p>

<p><i>Italian</i> and Music for a fine Lady should
be inseparable; for tho’ it is allowed that
our Music is vastly improved within half a
Century past, yet the Critics in that way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
insist, that Music in our Language is incapable
of equalling the <i>Italian</i>, from the
great Number of Consonants it abounds
with.</p>

<p>When a young Lady is advanced thus
far, she has certainly done a great deal; but
not enough. If she is taught to think that
the Great must be distinguished by their superior
Knowledge, she will be animated
with a Desire to acquire it; and not sit
down contented with an inferior Degree of
it. Still, as deep Studies and very close
Application seem by Nature more the Province
of Men than Women, so I have not
urged the Study of the more learned Languages;
and will leave this Point to be determined
by the Parents and Preceptors.
History, ’tis true, gives us many Examples
of Queens and Ladies of every Rank, who
were distinguished by their great Learning.
Sir <i>Thomas More</i>, High Chancellor of <i>England</i>,
in a Letter to his Daughter, commends
her for the Purity and Elegance of her
<i>Latin</i>; and Madam <i>Dacier</i>, Daughter of
<i>Tanaquil Faber</i>, is well known (besides her
other learned Works) to have translated
<i>Homer</i> from the <i>Greek</i>: but these are rare
Examples, and such perhaps as should rather
be admired than imitated. Nature, I think,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
points out to us, that the Education of a Woman
should rather be sprightly than grave;
thus polite Literature seems a fitter Study
for a Lady than Syllogisms in Logic. However,
that a Lady of Quality may by no
means be deficient, she should have, besides
what is already recommended, a Knowledge
of Arithmetic, Geography, and Drawing;
to which may, with great Propriety, be
added, at least a general Acquaintance with
Moral and Experimental Philosophy.</p>

<p>The Sketch here given is not to be considered
as the Edifice, but the Ground-work,
the Foundation alone; the Superstructure
is still to be raised. In order thereto
a young Lady is to be nicely directed
what Language she should speak, and what
shun: what ought to be her Sentiments,
her Deportment, and her Actions. But first
she should be taught to know that the World
has it’s Eyes upon her, and that in proportion
as she increases in Merit, so much
nearer will she approach to gaining universal
Admiration and Esteem. The Reasonableness
of this Admonition will appear, if
it be considered how many Actions we do
unworthy ourselves, only because we are unobserved,
or at least think we are so;
whereas by keeping our Attention awake,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
and considering ourselves as always beheld,
we shall often blush at the very Approach
of Vice and Folly, and thus nobly fly from
them. Yet this Consideration of being beheld,
tho’ in itself a Virtue, must be carefully
inculcated and nicely distinguished, lest
it degenerate into a vain Desire of Applause:
her Business is to deserve Esteem, but not
to look for it. We often see a half-bred
Player stare about him when he has finished
his Speech, as if he would beg a Clap, a
Smile, or a Nod of Approbation; but we
never see this in a thorough bred one; he
attends to his Part, to his Business, and nothing
else; he knows that the best way to
obtain and secure Applause, is to deserve it.</p>

<p>I have said a young Lady should be nicely
directed what Books she is to read; indeed
it is too nice a Matter for me to determine;
Mr. <i>Addison</i>, in one of his <i>Spectators</i>, has,
in a burlesque Way, given a Sort of Lady’s
Library; but I wish he had reversed it, and
told them seriously what Books would grace
a Lady’s Closet, and improve her Mind.
For my own Part I think nothing is more
difficult, even among Men, than a proper
Choice of Books. Wisdom and Virtue are
the great Sciences we are born to learn;
Books and Men are the Channels to convey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
the Knowledge of them to us. Now most
Parents give their Children some general
Cautions against bad Company, but Books
are usually thrown into one undistinguished
Heap: and tho’ some perhaps are pointed
out to us as good, we are not instructed to
shun the bad; at least they are still open to
our View. Witness the Swarms of lewd
Plays, Poems and Romances, calculated to
inflame the Minds, and corrupt the Hearts
of the Readers: witness the Sophistry and
false Reasoning of many Writers, who take
Pride in shewing how ingeniously they can
deceive: witness the Loads of Lumber produced
by those, whose Talents have been
mistaken by making them Scholars without
Genius: and witness too the Train of Trifles
the present Age abounds with. From this
clear and rational View of the State of
Books, is it not apparent how liable we
are to be misled? True it is, that we may
read our whole Lives and learn nothing, nay
far worse than nothing; learn Vice, Error,
and Impiety. Since then this Point is of such
Consequence to all, those in exalted Stations
of both Sexes should have very able and
faithful Guides herein; as from their Influence
so much Good or Bad must flow.
Still I must beg leave to caution Parents of
the highest Quality, to imprint on their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
Children’s Minds and Hearts this Maxim,
that all their Studies should tend to make
them wise and good. Convinced of this, as
they advance in Years, their own Judgment
and Goodness of Heart will, in great measure,
instruct them what to read, and what
to avoid.</p>

<p>A young Lady should be taught to speak
her Mother-tongue with great Clearness,
Purity, and Elegance; nothing coarse,
mean, or vulgar should ever drop from her
Lips; nothing uncouth, strained, or affected;
the one debases her Quality, and the
other her Understanding. Great Ladies may
perhaps think that their Greatness entitles
them to say any thing; but where this happens, it
is certainly an Error in their Education;
or at least it is one in their Practice.
There is yet a third Error in Speech
which Women of Rank should carefully
avoid; an Error consistent with good Sense,
but good Sense obscured; that of catching
every new-coin’d Word. The <i>English</i> being
a living Language, is subject to great
Variations and Changes; but is now deservedly
esteemed in high Perfection, as it is
certainly stronger, more expressive, and
more copious than heretofore. Still there
is Reason to fear, that every Change is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
an Amendment; and if it be, a Lady should
not be the first to adopt it: yet so it happens,
that a Desire to appear wise and learned
sometimes makes them over-shoot themselves,
and thus by aiming too high, they
are liable to fall too low.</p>

<p>The Sentiments of a young Lady of Quality
should be noble, virtuous, and pure.
While she is surrounded with external Grandeur,
she must be taught to support a Dignity
of Mind, without which, all her Pomp
will be mere Farce and Pageantry, and only
tend to inflame her Vanity; she must be
taught to know, that the noblest Sentiments
are those which inspire her with a Love of
Virtue; and to be truly great, she must
condescend frequently to revolve in her
Mind the Hardships, Sorrow, Pain, and
Sufferings of the various States beneath her:
above all, she must be taught to maintain a
spotless Innocence; and live in a constant
Resolution to suffer any thing, however
great, rather than disgrace her Birth and
Quality by any Action unworthy of herself.</p>

<p>Her Deportment must answer her Quality,
and be elevated, majestic, and noble;
such as will strike us with Awe, at the same
time that we see in it a Complacency and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
Affability which charms us: such as will not
suffer even the most bold and abandoned to
offer the least Indecency or Rudeness, at the
same time that it discovers a Heart susceptible
of the tenderest Impressions. An easy
Grace, a lively chearful Air should accompany
all she says and does; but lest this
should degenerate into Levity, she must be
instructed never to throw off, that great Ornament
of the Sex, Modesty.</p>

<p>Her Actions must be such as will contribute
to others Happiness and her own; such
as will reflect a Lustre on herself, and attract
the Beholders of them to an unfeigned
Esteem for her: Generosity, Benevolence,
Charity, and Humility, accompanied with
a Sweetness of Temper, should alternately
prevail: and if the Distresses of others
sometimes intrude too far upon her, (which
from their great Severity they are apt to do)
let her not add Misery to Misery, by dropping
the Air of her Countenance, or use any
Bitterness of Expression, at the same time
that she refuses to relieve.</p>

<p>I have here laboured to shew what Education
is necessary to adorn a Woman of
Quality; and will leave it to abler Pens to
refine, to correct, and improve it. What I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
hope and wish is, that the Plan here laid
down may be deemed natural, practicable,
and no way repugnant to good Sense: nothing
stoical, wild, or romantic; nothing,
in short, (allowing for the Difference of Genius,
Health, and other Circumstances) but
what every Woman of Quality may and
ought to be. But before I quit this Head,
I cannot help remarking how injuriously
Men often think and speak of the Capacities
of the other Sex. If all be true that they
urge, (which with some is still a Doubt)
that the Understandings of Women are
weaker than those of Men, yet it by no
means excuses our excluding them from
Education. Nature indeed seems to have
formed the Men strong in Mind and Body,
that they may labour either with their Understandings
or their Limbs as Occasion requires;
the Women more tender, for Employments of
a gentler Kind: thus each
have their several Provinces: allowing then
the Woman to be the weaker Vessel, that is,
neither her Frame nor Faculties so strong as
the Man’s, does it imply that she has no
Strength, no Faculties at all? by no Means.
Experience shews us that the Sex have Wit,
Judgment, and a Capacity to learn; how
then can we justify our too general Neglect
of them? But this Error is of great Consequence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
even to ourselves. If our Love for
the Sex extends no farther than a gross Sense,
we miss our Aim if we expect to find Happiness;
or if we go so far as to consider them
useful in their domestic Capacity, that will
not secure to us the agreeable: good Sense,
and good Temper, improved more or less
by Education, should be every Man’s View
in a Partner for Life; and where shall we
find them, if their Education be universally
neglected? A rational Man should choose
a rational Companion; but how will such
be found, if Pains are taken to keep them
ignorant? Thus it is evident, that we are
injuring ourselves, and Posterity too, by this
unworthy Treatment of the Sex. Still it
seems reasonable, that as Men are to bear
the Burden of Business, they should have
superior Education, as well as superior
Strength; therefore the only thing here contended
for, is, that every Woman should
have her Mind improved, her Understanding
enlarged by such an Education as is best
suited to her Condition in Life: such an
one, in short, as will make her lastingly
pleasing by being both useful and agreeable.</p>

<p>The Transition from the Nobility to the
Gentry is very easy; for whatever Difference
there may be as to Rank and Title, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
certain that many private Gentlemen have
equal Ability to educate their Children as
they please. The Plan then already laid
down for the Education of a Nobleman,
will in general hold good here. The eldest
Son, to whom our Laws give the Estate,
should resemble our young Nobleman as
nearly as may be; not from a vain Desire
of being equal to him, (tho’ it is the Way
to make him so) but from a laudable Ambition
of being excell’d by none in Learning
and Virtue. Still there will sometimes be
great Difficulty to persuade young Gentlemen
who are thus situated to apply themselves
to Study: the early Knowledge they
have of the Fortune they are to inherit
makes them giddy; and they leave Study
to their younger Brothers. What then is
to be done? Parents must discard their outward
Fondness for their Children, to prove
their inward Affection; for how can they be
said to love them, while they suffer them to
live in Ignorance? how can they be said to
love Virtue, yet lead their Children into
Vice? Parents then must do violence to
themselves, they must be in earnest, and
consider that the Education of their Children is
an indispensable Obligation. Parents, whatever
be their Fortune, must exert a due Authority
over their Children; must shew them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
they are serious, and convince them that
they will not be trifled with. Dr. <i>Busby</i>,
the famous Master of <i>Westminster</i> School, is
said to have made more eminent Scholars
than any Man of his Time; the Reason is
obvious, he was in earnest; his Scholars
durst not trifle their Time away, or neglect
their Studies: whether or no he carried it
with so nice a Hand as never to err by his
Rigour, I will not presume to determine;
but if he did, it is no Matter of Surprise,
since every Man is liable to Error. Whoever
considers the Depravity of our Nature,
how propense we are to love Ease, and fly
from Labour, will be convinced that Boys
stand in need of every Help to make them
diligent. The Authority of the Parents,
the Authority of the Masters, a Sense of
their Duty, and a pleasing Prospect of Reward,
by the Acquisition of Knowledge, must
all combine to enforce their Compliance:
and happy will it be for them if they can all
produce the desired Effect. But it will be
happier still, if the joint Endeavours of Parents
and Teachers can create in Boys a
Love for Study, and an ardent Desire to
gain Knowledge: then it is we see them go
to their Book with as much Alacrity as they
go to Dinner; then it is we see them striving
to excel; and the Knowledge they gain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
from a Love of Learning, makes them
sprightly and happy in themselves and pleasing
to all that see them. Besides, this Turn
of Mind has something in it so promising,
that it is what every thinking Parent would
wish for, and should earnestly strive to inculcate;
yet he must not be surprised if he
does not always find it; and indeed Experience
shews us, that it is generally necessary
to govern Children with a tight Rein: for
early Indulgence does them incredible Mischief;
in particular, it gives them a Reluctance
for Study very hard to be conquered.</p>

<p>When these first Difficulties are got over,
Parents should then apply themselves to
their Children’s Understanding: the joining
Reason and Authority together will give
double Weight to their Injunctions. Suppose
then a Father addressing his Son, let
us see what Reason will dictate. “Do you
know, my Dear, why you go to School?
why I engage you in Study, and
threaten you so severely if you neglect
it? is it for my Sake, think you? or
is it because I take Pleasure in giving
you Pain? no; it is for your Sake alone
that I thus urge your Obedience. Providence
has made me the Instrument of
your Being; therefore, as your natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
Guardian, I am accountable for your
Education: Learning is the Road to
Knowledge; Knowledge will lead you
to Virtue; and Virtue to Happiness.
Need you then any other Inducements to
learn than the Duty you owe to me, and the
Advantages that will accrue to yourself?
no surely; I trust you will want no other
Motive.” Is not this Method both rational
and natural? I think it is undeniably
so; and that, by these easy Means, Parents
may, in general, promise themselves great
Comfort in their Children by guiding them
as they see proper. Children, if moulded
while young, readily yield, like Wax, to
the Impression; yet now they are merely
passive: but when Reason gains Strength,
when they see their Parents acting with a
generous Affection for their Good alone, then
it is that they are animated with a Love of
Duty, and with a Desire to become every
thing that they would have them be.</p>

<p>Every Gentleman of Fortune should certainly
give all his Sons the Education of
Gentlemen; and therefore the younger
Brothers are, in the fundamental Points of
Education, to accompany the eldest: but
tho’ this be granted in general, yet there are
certain particular Rules to be observed;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
some one Point to be excepted against, another
to be pursued, with many other things,
according as Circumstances vary, all which
require the Parents Attention. I have just
observed, that the Foundation of their
Learning should in all the Sons be becoming
the Stock they spring from: but the
eldest must be graced with every Ornament.
He must be taught to know, that possessing
a Fortune superior to his Brothers, obliges
him to acquire superior Qualifications. He
is to consider himself as one designed to do
Honour to his Family, and to his Country;
and be convinced, that if he neglects to cultivate
his Mind, he will be a Disgrace to both.</p>

<p>Parents of this Class have, with regard to
their younger Sons, two principal things to
do: first, they are carefully to attend to
their Genius, Temper, and Inclinations;
and next they are to resolve on an Employment
suited to them: this settled, they are
to pursue their Education accordingly. The
three learned Professions, Divinity, Law,
and Physic, require not only deep Erudition,
but require too a Species of Learning
proper to each; besides, as these are Employments
of the most serious Nature, and
of the most weighty Consequence, not to
give them all the Qualifications that human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
Wit is capable of attaining, is surely a grievous
Error. Yet are there sometimes other
Errors too material to pass unobserved: not
those of the Head, but of the Heart. It is
in general hoped, that where due Care is
taken in forming the Manners, the natural
Corruption of the Heart may be corrected;
but where that is neglected, or our Endeavours
to effect it prove fruitless, which, it
is to be feared, they sometimes will, the utmost
Care should be taken in the Choice of
an Employment for Life. It is a Rule in
Life, that where we cannot do any great
Good, we should do no Harm; and therefore
it should be a Rule with Parents to
place their bad Children, if they are so unhappy
as to have any, as remote from Mischief
as possible. Now to apply this to the
Matter in hand, we must observe, that to
fill up these important Stations with all their
just Requisites, we must not only have a
sound Education, and a clear Head; but
we must also have an upright Heart: that
is, we must resolve to banish every sinister
Aim, and have no Views but those of Justice,
Probity, and Honour. To what must
we ascribe the general Reproaches thrown
with so much Freedom on Professions which
have in their Nature the strongest Claim to
Respect, as their Foundation is Virtue,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
Truth, and Justice; but to the corrupted
Channels the Stream passes through? For
tho’ Men’s Judgments frequently err, and
false Constructions are often put on the best
Actions; yet it is to be feared the Complaints
are sometimes but too just. Men
strongly tempted by irregular Passions, whether
Pride, Avarice, Revenge, or others,
will naturally incline to gratify them: hence
then appears the Necessity, in these Professions
particularly, of well-regulated Hearts:
that on one side no Injury may be done, and
on the other, that no Censure may be justly
incurred.</p>

<p>It is to be presumed that the younger
Sons of every Gentleman’s Family (unless
by any lateral Means they have an independent
Fortune) are to engage in some Profession
or Employment, in order to their Advancement
in the World; and it is perfectly
right that they should: for by this means
they may not only fill up their Time like
reasonable Creatures, but become capable of
doing Honour to some Profession, be useful
to Mankind in general, and often raise a
Fortune equal to their elder Brother. Now
besides the learned Professions; the Sea, the
Army, and the Exchange, with many others,
needless to enumerate, are open for them to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
engage in; and hence farther appears not
only the Necessity of considering their Fortune,
but of attending to their Genius, Temper,
and Inclinations.</p>

<p>Nothing is more talked of than the Necessity
of consulting our Children’s Genius;
and I think verily there is nothing so little
understood, or so little attended to. I know
that many People say, there is nothing more
easy to discover than the Genius of Children;
but if we view the continual Errors
committed in this Point, we shall have reason
to think otherwise. What is more evident
than a general Partiality of Parents to
their Children? and what will naturally be
the Consequence of it? certainly a false Estimation
of their Capacity. However, difficult
as I think this Knowledge is to be obtained,
either from general Partiality, Want
of Penetration, or the natural Inconstancy of
Youth; yet let us not throw aside our Attention,
nor wildly give up our Children to
Chance; but rather let us improve the Reason
Providence has endowed us with, and
labour to draw such Conclusions as will most
conduce to their real Happiness. To act
therefore with Judgment in this weighty
Matter, Parents must not, because a Boy
says he will go to Sea, immediately send<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
him; nor because another says he will be a
Soldier, directly buy him a Commission.
One perhaps only wants to get away from
his Studies, and the other thinks it a fine
thing to wear a laced Coat. Youth is naturally
giddy, and what they like to-day,
they will often dislike to-morrow; Parents
therefore would be grievously mistaken, were
they to take every Start of Fancy, every
premature Request of their Children for Genius.
Still it is certain that they have many
Ways of discovering what they are capable
of, and what they are inclined to; therefore
our Prudence and Judgment are to go hand
in hand with these Discoveries. For Instance:
if we see a Boy of intrepid Courage,
loving, seeking, and enduring Hardships,
and dwelling with Delight on maritime Affairs,
at the same time that he has virtuous
Dispositions, and both loves and applies to
his Books; we need not hesitate to breed
him to the Sea. So if we are convinced,
that another seeks a Commission from true
Honour and Courage, and from an ardent
Desire to serve his King and Country, we
may encourage his laudable Ambition; but
if we discover that his Motives are those of
being conspicuously dress’d, of sauntering and
dangling one part of his Time away, and
raking and gaming another part; if we see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
too, that his only Fear, is the Fear of having
occasion to fight; we should certainly
reject his Request, and oblige him to apply
another way: nay more, we should convince
him how mean a Soul he must have, to seek
so inglorious a life. In like manner, if we
see a Boy whose Head is manifestly turned
for Business, whose Cast of Temper argues
Method in every Action, we may pretty
safely conclude we hit his Genius, by making
him a Merchant. But there is a capital
Mistake Parents frequently commit, that is,
their being influenced by some oblique Interest;
which often tends to ruin their Children.
For Example: the Family has a
Living in their Gift, and a Boy must be
bred a Clergyman on purpose to fill it: or
there is an Uncle a Bishop, therefore the
Nephew must be a Bishop too; tho’ perhaps
he has no more Genius nor Chance for
it, than he has of being Emperor of <i>Morocco</i>.
Thus another, who would have been
an Adept in the Mathematics, and have
done Honour to the Science, or whose
Sprightliness would have made a Figure in
polite Literature, is cramp’d with the Study
of the Law; not because he likes it, but because
it is a Profession that may raise him to
be a Judge; perhaps Lord Chancellor:
tho’ he has as little Chance for either as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
Clerk to a Justice of Peace. A third, in
Nature’s spite, is made a Physician, only because
his Parents have seen a <i>Mead</i>, a <i>Hulse</i>,
or a <i>Wilmot</i> standing at the Top of the Profession;
and therefore conclude their Son
will have equal Genius and equal Merit.</p>

<p>Here then it is evident, that Parents are
often mistaken, not only by Inattention to
the Genius of their Children, but by overrating
their Parts; by fixing a Profession for
them, perhaps as soon as they are born, or
by blundering them into an Employment
which their Education is not equal to. On
this last Point let me explain myself. Suppose
I have not over-rated a Boy’s natural
Parts; suppose too that I have at great Expence
kept him at School for ten Years; it
does not from hence follow that he is learned: I
must know if he has applied and improved
these Years to his real Advantage;
that is, whether his Learning is deep or superficial;
I must know too the Tenor of his
Studies, for even of those who are very diligent,
all Parts of Learning are not equal
Favourites; some are sprightly, some grave,
some in short more striking to them than
others: lastly, I must know if the Nature of
his Education be adapted to the Employment
I am about to engage him in. Without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
Attention and Regard to these Circumstances,
it will be impossible to keep clear of
Error in the Disposal of our Children for
Life: and as not only themselves, but Society
too, must feel the good or bad Effects
of our Choice, it is of the highest Consequence
that it be judicious.</p>

<p>But Genius is not the only thing to be
considered in the fixing our Sons for Life.
Mr. <i>Pope</i> has a Position,<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> which does not
tally with general Observation; for according
to him there will hardly be a Man in
ten thousand qualify’d for the Station he is
in. True Genius is, I think, but rarely to
be met with; plain natural good Sense,
carefully improved by Education, will certainly
enable the Generality of Men to become
Proficients in any single Art or Science:
that is, as by well directed Steps they
are capable of acquiring great Perfection in
one Way, so would they have been equally
perfect had their Steps been directed another
Way. Our Defects in general are not so
much owing to the Want of Parts, as to
the Want of cultivating them; hence appears
that amazing Weakness in some Parents,
in shewing a Boy as a Prodigy, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
every other Eye can see there is nothing uncommon
in him; and hence too appears the
Folly of others in neglecting those Improvements
so essentially necessary for him.</p>

<p>From what has been here advanced it is
pretty evident, that a young Gentleman of
moderate Parts well improved, is capable of
becoming whatever is pointed out for him,
provided he is diligent. But here it is my
earnest Request, that Parents resolve to
make their Children happy; and this they
cannot do but by complying in some measure
with their Temper and Inclinations;
for it is on this chiefly their Felicity depends.
The same Boy (as I observed before) would
become an Adept either in This or That
Employment, but it is perhaps one only
that will make him happy: therefore it is
not always Genius, but Inclination, that requires
our Regard.</p>

<p>The seeming Resemblance of Genius and
Inclination may make some People take
them for the same thing. Genius is a natural
Gift, a Power in the Soul to do what
another, without that Genius, cannot do:
Inclination is a natural Propensity to pursue
some certain Employment, whether we have
Genius to execute it or not. We are told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
of <i>Cicero</i>, that no Man had a stronger Inclination
to be a Poet than himself; yet with
all his great Abilities he had not a Genius
for it. So in our own Times, we have seen
Men with the greatest Itch of Writing produce
nothing that argued Genius; some
fond of Music almost to Distraction, without
a Power of acquiring it: and others
with a Passion for Painting, whose Genius
amounted to nothing more than to dawb.
On the other hand, there are Men possessed
of Genius, but devoid of Inclination; so
true is it, that however similar they appear,
they are really distinct in themselves, sometimes
very near to, at other times very distant
from, one another. But to return to
our Subject. As we have observed, that
uncommon Genius is not to be always expected,
and as we have shewn, that general
good Capacity seldom is wanting; nothing
more remains but to learn what Employment
will suit our Sons Temper and Inclinations,
and then compleat their Education
accordingly. For surely it is wrong to insist
on a Boy’s applying to the Law, when
the Delight of his Soul is the Study of Physic
and the Knowledge of Nature. Or is it
not wrong to pin another down to the Study
of Divinity, when Commerce engrosses his
whole Attention; or his dauntless Heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
burns to traverse the Ocean? and is it not
equally wrong to make a Boy a Merchant,
who delights in the Study of the Law?
most certainly. These therefore are the
things we must attend to, these the general
Steps to be taken or avoided; and as none
but general Rules can be laid down, the particular
Exceptions every Parent’s Judgment
must supply.</p>

<p>A young Lady of the second Rank comes
next under my Consideration: but as I have
dwelt pretty largely on the Woman of Quality,
I have not occasion to say much here.
One material Distinction to be made in a
Lady of this Class is, whether she is an only
Child, an Heiress, no Brother in the way
to enjoy the Estate; or whether she is only
a younger Child, and is to share the Fate of
her younger Brothers or Sisters. In the first
Case, I would recommend that her Education
approach to that of a Woman of Quality,
since it is highly probable she will become
one; at least if her Education, Conduct,
and Deportment correspond with
those of superior Rank, she will always be
Company for them: but, in the other
Case, that is, where a Brother sweeps away
the Estate, it is certain that her Education<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
need not be so brilliant, nor ought to be so
expensive as in the first. Yet let not this
damp a young Lady’s Spirits; I do not
mean to make her less happy, nor recommend
the least Neglect of her; far from it.
A State Coach with three Footmen answers
no better than a plain Coach with one, for
all the Purposes of a Coach: and a Diamond
Necklace keeps a Lady no warmer than a
Necklace of inferior Value. Thus it is with
the Education of a Woman of Quality; it
is in some measure merely ornamental, without
being essential to her Happiness. Still
it is fit it should be so. When the Superscription
of a Letter begins with Her Grace,
or Right Honourable, when a Coach or
Chair appears with a Coronet, ’tis fit that
due Deference and due Distance be observed;
and to secure this, ’tis fit that her Education
have a suitable Dignity. But, as I have just
observed, this is not essential to her Happiness:
and if those in private Life, and of
moderate Fortunes, aim at equalling these
either in external Appearances, or in too
exalted an Education, they are pretty sure
of running into Error; for Happiness much
depends on an Education suited to our Condition
in Life. Thus while I esteem it a
Misfortune for a Woman of Rank not to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
appear to the utmost Advantage, it seems no
less a Misfortune for a young Lady in private
Life vainly to aspire at equalling her.</p>

<p>Still I warmly urge, that no contemptuous
Neglect be shewn her; let her be
taught as thorough a Knowledge of her Mother-tongue
as if she were a Princess; let
her too write, and dance, and speak <i>French</i>
to Perfection: Music too I recommend, but
not to Perfection. Here, I am afraid, my
Readers will start, and think that either the
Author or the Printer has committed an
Error; but a little Patience, and we shall, I
hope, understand one another. When we
consult a Physician, or a Council, they take
the Fee, and give us their Opinion; which
Opinion we may either reject or follow as
we please. When I set out in this Undertaking,
I declared myself not a Lawgiver,
but an Adviser; as such then let me be considered.
I speak my Mind freely, and like
an honest Lawyer give my Opinion honestly;
where the Advice is good, follow it;
where erroneous, reject it: thus should all
reasonable People do, taking along with
them this Caution, not to condemn rashly
and precipitately, but weigh the Matter
well; and neither lavishly bestow unjust
Praises, nor unfairly rob Merit of it’s Due.
This premised, I return to my Subject. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
is very certain, that a young Lady of this
Class should learn Music; it gives her a
sprightly pleasing Air; it is a fine Relaxation
from more serious Employments; and it
greatly contributes to keep up a Chearfulness
thro’ the whole Family: but I would not
have her ambitious to excel; and I think
Parents ought not to covet it. To attain
Music to great Perfection, and to study the
<i>Italian</i> for that Purpose, is a Work of great
Labour, Time, and Expence; too much by
far to gain what at last amounts to no more
than an Amusement. Ladies of great Rank
and Fortune have every thing at their Command,
therefore should aim at Perfection in
all they undertake; but those in more private
Life, have certainly other things to do.
They are, by all the Rules of Prudence, to
be taught to work: they should be taught
to know too, that they must reduce their
Theory to Practice. They are to stoop
likewise to domestic Cares; whereby they
will often be enabled to boast a Happiness
which greater Ladies are Strangers to. But
supposing that either to gratify herself or her
Friends she engages deeply in the Study of
Music; Parents are here often cajoled out
of their Money, and their Senses too, by
their Daughter’s fancied Excellence: and
the same Man that is lavish in his Praises to
the fond Father’s Face, will perhaps in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
very next Company swear the Girl squeaks
like a Pig. There is a great deal of Insincerity,
nay the grossest Flattery, attends this
kind of Study; and Parents in general have
need of better Eyes than common to see thro’
it. However, not to injure the young
Lady’s Capacity, I will grant that she really
does excel: still I say, her Time might have
been much better employed in acquiring
more useful Knowledge: such as is properly
suited to her Station. There are yet other
Inconveniencies attending this Study when a
Lady excels, or has the Reputation of it;
that of exposing both her and the Parents to
a great deal of gay Company at least, if no
worse; such as tends to dissipate the Mind,
to shut out Reflection, and thereby check or
prevent the Knowledge of more weighty
Obligations: and it often likewise exposes
them to a great deal of ill-timed Expence:
which, as every Day’s Experience shews us,
frequently does great Harm, but seldom any
Good.</p>

<p>It is certain that every populous Place,
especially a polite City like <i>London</i>, ought
to have some Entertainments of this Kind;
and Persons of Quality and Fortune should
give due Encouragement to them, as the Performers
make it their Bread, and labour their
whole Lives to excel, that they may give them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
the utmost Entertainment in their Power:
all this, I say, is highly reasonable, if reasonably
used. But will not a Concert, an
Opera, or an Oratorio always furnish this?
most certainly. Is it worth a young Lady’s
while, whose Fortune perhaps will be but
scanty, to consume a great deal of Time
and Money, and at last fall short of a Stage-performer?
by no Means: any more than
it is an Honour to a Man of Quality to be
called the first Fiddle in the Kingdom; or
for a Gentleman to boast that he can beat
his Coachman at driving.</p>

<p>If to the Steps already laid down of a
young Lady’s Education of this Rank be
added Arithmetic, Drawing, and Geography,
I think every thing will be done that
her Parents need Wish; and enough, if well
improved, to enable her to make a very advantageous
Figure. Still she should be
taught to know that this is only learning the
Road; and she herself, with these Guides,
is to take care not to go wrong: good Company,
good Books, and an Attention to her
own Actions, are to compleat her. She
should not aim at more deep or learned Studies,
which probably would only make her
affected or pedantic; make her a Pain to
herself, and disgustful to all who converse
with her, particularly her own Sex. Knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
does not consist in Words, but in
Things; and a Language, merely as a
Language, conveys only the Knowledge of
Words. If on this Foundation, and with
these Materials, she builds with Care, with
Diligence and Judgment, I dare affirm, that
these alone will furnish her with every Means
of being wise and happy.</p>

<p>I am now to treat of the third Class of
People, the Men of Trade and Commerce,
in which I comprize the Merchants, and all
those that are usually distinguished by the
Epithets of genteel Trades and good Businesses:
such as require Figure, Credit, Capital,
and many other Circumstances to conduct
and support them: But I confess there
is no small Difficulty herein. In some Countries
the Gentry and the Men of Trade are
as distinct People as if each were a Kingdom
by itself: <i>England</i>, a trading Nation, connects
more closely the whole Body of the
People; links them, as it were, in one continued
Chain, and brings them nearer to a
Level. The Man of Trade marries the
Daughter of the Gentleman; the Gentleman
the Tradesman’s Daughter: and again, the
Gentleman makes his Son (the younger at
least) a Man of Trade. Hence arises the
Difficulty of separating them; nor can it indeed
be altogether done. The Reputation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
and Value of Trade has convinced Gentlemen
of the Usefulness and Necessity of an
Alliance with it; and Trade is greatly indebted
to the many and great Fortunes
thrown into it from the Produce of Estates:
thus are they blended and interwoven; and
thus are they become reciprocally beneficial.
Still, according to the general State of
things, regarding the various Ranks in
Life, I think we may make one sensible Distinction
without Offence; that is, Gentlemen
may be said to stoop or condescend to
Trade, and Trade may be said to aspire not
only to an Alliance with Gentry, but to become
Gentry too. Thus while I honour
Trade, I would by no means fail to pay a
due Respect to Gentry; and therefore give
them that Preference they are intitled to.</p>

<p>Birth, Education, and Manners, may be
said to constitute the Gentleman. Birth
alone, tho’ a Claim, is too poor a one to
deserve that Title; Education adds indeed
a Lustre to Birth; but both together are
not sufficient without Manners: that is, to
complete the Gentleman, they should all
unite. To adjust this Matter fairly, we may
without Impropriety urge, that Manners
alone will give us a better Claim than Birth
and Education together; and why? because
these are not in our Power to choose. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
Example: It is not my Fault that I was not
born a Nobleman, nor did I choose my own
Education, but my Parents for me; yet
when once I have learnt to know Right
from Wrong, if I chuse the Right, and labour
to maintain it for Virtue’s Sake; surely
some Degree of Merit is mine: therefore,
to use again the good old Bishop of <i>Winchester</i>’s
Motto, <span class="smcap">Manners maketh Man</span>.
Still, as I observed before, to perfect the
Character, all should combine: and thus if
the Man of Trade depends on his Acquisitions
only, he will find himself greatly mistaken.
There is a pleasant Story told of
King <i>Charles</i> II. I think not unapplicable
here. An unbred Citizen becoming very
rich, made a Friend at Court, who informed
the King he desired much to be made a
Gentleman; That, says the King, with a
Smile, is not perhaps in my Power; but
tell him, I’ll do better, I’ll make him a
Knight. Thus at the same time that he
conferred an Honour, he ingeniously reproached
him, by shewing, that, to make a
Gentleman, required something more than
even Money or Title. The principal thing
then that Men of Trade have to do is, to
keep clear of Self-sufficiency; and avoid
that Arrogance and Conceit which Money
is apt to create. Their frequent Marriages
and Intermarriages with well-bred People,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
are some Means to effect this; and educating
their Children suitably is another. Thus
the rising Generation at least will be improved;
and hence appears the Necessity of
good Education and well-regulated Manners
for this Class of People: that as they insensibly,
as it were, become allied to their Betters,
they may be taught properly to coincide
with them.</p>

<p>Many Reasons prove the Necessity of
good Education for People of this Class. In
a Society of Men, suppose a Coffee-house,
we see a promiscuous Croud of Gentlemen
and Men of Trade; in an Assembly of Women,
we see mixed with the Gentry, not
only the Wife of the Merchant, but that of
the Brewer, the Distiller, the Druggist, and
the Draper; and it is highly necessary that
these should have such Education, and their
Manners so regulated, as will make them
fit Company for those. But there are more
weighty Reasons yet. Every Man conversant
in Life, must have observed, not only
the many calamitous Falls from high to
low; but also the frequent Progressions from
low to high; and where these Advancements
are the Fruits of honest Industry, I
rejoice with them in their Success. A Citizen
grown rich by Trade, resolves to approach
to the Gentry; and his first Advance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
is usually to the Center of the Town. Here
for a while he sits down, and with sweet
Content enjoys the Fruit of his past Labours;
but perhaps it is only for a
while; the Heart of Man is restless, and he
burns to taste the Manners of the Court:
thus he flies to St. <i>James</i>’s <i>Square</i>, <i>Grosvenor
Square</i>, <i>Berkley Square</i>, or one of the surrounding
Streets; thus the Son gets a Post,
and the Daughter marries a Lord; and thus
the next Generation or two reaches the Summit
of Grandeur and Honour. If things are
so, and daily Experience proves they are, is
it not highly necessary to set out with a good
Education? most certainly. Still it should
be a suitable one. A Man of Trade may be
qualified to keep his Betters Company,
without vainly aspiring to be like them; for
that would be rendering him unfit for the
very Trade he is engaged in. Every Man
may and ought to look forward; but if
every Man anxiously dwells on future Greatness,
and continually dreams of Posts,
Titles, and Palaces, it is the certain Way
never to reach them: for tho’ the Advancements
just pointed out are, I think, literally
true, yet are the Instances but few in comparison
with the whole. Therefore the Business
of Parents is, to give their Children
first a just Sense of their present Station;
then to guide their Education, and regulate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
their Manners accordingly; that done, leave
the rest to Providence.</p>

<p>I hope this Reasoning upon the close
Connection of Gentry and Trade is clear
and express; and proves what I advanced,
that they are not to be wholly separated.
Whence it appears, that the Education both
of Boys and Girls of this Class must in general
be like that of the preceding. Still
some Judgment, Prudence, and Self-knowledge
are necessary to guide Parents herein.</p>

<p>The first wise Caution is, that Parents
consider their own Fortune, and the real
Prospects before them: it is not enough
that a Man be of such or such a Trade, to
entitle him to train his Child equal to another
of the same Trade; for if this be
taken as a Guide, many grievous Errors will
be committed. What can be a greater Misfortune,
than to educate a Boy like a fine
Gentleman, and not be able to support it?
or to train a Girl with the Expectation of
keeping her Coach, and have little or nothing
to give her? yet is this often the
Case. Another Caution is, not to neglect
such an Education as may be at least solidly
useful, if they cannot reach the ornamental
Part; for as Carving, Gilding, and Painting
may at any time be added to adorn a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
well-proportioned Room, so a sound Education
is every Day capable of Improvement:
and as the Vicissitudes of Life are
many, it is right that Children should on
every proper Occasion be able to prove the
Goodness of the Stock they spring from.
To set this Matter in the clearest Light, let
us suppose any two of the same Business, no
matter what; one has a large Trade and
small Family, the other a small Trade and
large Family; the Trade being the same,
our Idea of both the Men will at first Sight
be alike; but if we come to a nearer View,
and thence draw a Comparison, we shall
find it very unequal: for tho’ a Merchant
is still a Merchant, yet while one has great
Difficulty to give his Daughter a single
thousand Pound, the other can with Ease
give his twenty thousand. Thus, tho’ each
should educate his Children suitable to his
Character, yet each should at the same consider
his Abilities.</p>

<p>Many other Rules laid down in the preceding
Class hold equally good in this. The
Genius and Frame of Mind are to be attended
to; particular Studies are to be appropriated
to particular Employments; the
Disposition of Soul should be nicely searched
into, that every thing mean, narrow, or
base, may be subdued by the Principles of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
generous Education. Most young People,
even of both Sexes, place their Happiness
in external Appearance, but Girls have naturally
the strongest Passion for Dress and
Show; now Parents can never make the
Education of their Children solid, unless
they reverse this Disposition, not only by
teaching them the Emptiness of this false
Happiness, but by teaching them where to
find the true. There is indeed an Appearance
suitable to every Station, which to neglect,
would be sinking into Meanness, and
be a Disrespect to those we live among; that
then should be regarded, but that alone; for
all above should be made indifferent to us:
Happiness is in the Mind, and to improve
the Mind is the Way to reach it. Nor is
Happiness more among the Great, with all
their Grandeur, than among the Little; and
if it be, the Fault is in ourselves; since nothing
is truer than the Maxim, which says,
that Happiness does not consist in enlarging
our Possessions, but in contracting our Desires.
Nothing therefore can be more dangerous
in the educating our Children, than
cherishing in them a Passion for Dress, especially
the raising them above their Abilities.
Children should be taught to know,
that it is not how they look, but what they
feel, that deserves Solicitude: thus too in
estimating Riches; it is not what we lose,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
but what we suffer, that merits our Regard;
since we may sometimes lose a great deal,
and suffer nothing.</p>

<p>Parents, in educating their Children, are
to make them pleasing and useful. It is the
Opinion of several ingenious Writers, that
the first Appearance of a Stranger makes the
strongest and most lasting Impression on us;
that, as they shew to more or less Advantage
at first Sight, so do we think more or less
favourably of them ever after. Now, tho’
I do not think this is universally true, since
Experience shews us that some who strike us
at first never give us any Pleasure in their
Company afterwards, and others who have
nothing very pleasing in the Beginning of
our Acquaintance, improve upon us at
every Visit, and insensibly gain our Esteem;
yet it is certain, that our Deportment should
always be such as may dispose People to
think favourably of us, and never such as
can justly offend. But here I must observe,
that young People are very apt to prostitute
this Disposition, by using it only occasionally;
whereas, to make it a Virtue, it must
be exercised universally, and become a
settled Habit; in short, it must flow from
the Heart. A young Gentleman is to pay
a Visit to a great Man, to a rich Aunt, or
to some Person of Distinction, of whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
perhaps he has Views or Expectations;
what Pains are taken to make a graceful
Appearance, how exact is his Deportment,
how nice is his Behaviour, and how pleasing
his Conversation! The Visit paid, the Mask is
thrown off, and he is a very Bear to every
one else; nay perhaps even to his Parents,
to whom he owes all that he enjoys. So
too a young Lady who is to make her Appearance
at an Assembly; no Player studies
more to get their Part before they come on
the Stage, than she to attract her Beholders;
but then, like them too, when her
Part is over, she often falls below herself.
But have Actions like these any Merit in
them? can it be a Virtue never to be civil
but where we expect to gain by it? ought
we not to give every thing it’s proper Name,
and call such Behaviour Dissimulation and
Hypocrisy? most certainly. To obviate
then this Error in our Children, and prove
the real Use of Education, let Parents be
very careful to teach them an universal good
Behavior; not partial, narrow, or confined,
but such as will shew itself at all Times,
on all Occasions, and to all Degrees of
People: and if, as has been observed, the
first Impressions generally make for or
against us according as we behave, Youth
must be taught to consider themselves as
continually seen by somebody or other for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
the first time; and therefore they must always
demean themselves in such manner as
to deserve Esteem, if they ever hope to
gain it.</p>

<p>The other Point of Education is to make
our Children useful; therefore nothing that
can contribute to it should be omitted. A
young Man, besides the first Education bestowed
on him, besides the Pains taken by
his Parents to engage him in such a Station
as gives him the fairest Prospect of Happiness
to himself, must be instructed to employ
his Talents to the Benefit of others;
and in all things, as far as is consistent with
Prudence, Justice, and Self-preservation,
promote the Happiness and Advantage of
every one within his Reach. Here let me
add, that while our Laws give the Men superior
Power, a Father should be very careful
to fix in his Son a tender regard to the
opposite Sex; not indeed to become their
Slaves, or degenerate into Effeminacy; not to
be the Dupe of those who study to allure;
but to have a just Sense of their Merit, their
Innocence, and their Virtue: and thence resolve
never to despise, insult, or oppress
them, nor ever to impose a Hardship on
them too great to bear. A Girl, on the
other hand, is to be taught, that a Degree
of Subjection is allotted her; but that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
must never be base, nor ever need be mean.
She must know too, that the Fruits of her
Education are to appear in her Actions; to this
End, besides her Knowledge of Books, the
Exercise of her Needle, her Pen, and her
Figures, she is to understand the Management
of a House, be acquainted with the
various Seasons of Provisions, the Price of
Markets, Skill in Carving, Demeanour at
Table, and, in a Word, the whole Oeconomy
of a Family. Lastly, she must know
that her Province is to please, and that every
Deviation from it, is thwarting Nature; but
that the chearful Exercise of those Obligations
her Station requires, will best secure
Happiness to herself, and the Esteem of all
who behold her.</p>

<p>I flatter myself that what I have here said,
will furnish my Readers of this Class with
some Help to guide them thro’ the Difficulties
that naturally attend their Duty as Parents.
And if to this they add the Exercise
of their own Judgment, by varying the
Rules as they see necessary, their Children
will undoubtedly receive much Improvement;
and reflect great Honour on themselves,
who thus aim at the general Good,
not only of their own Offspring, but of all
Posterity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span></p>

<p>I have here enlarged on the Steps necessary
to be taken for educating three Classes
of People, and now proceed to treat of the
fourth; which comprehends a very large
Part of the Kingdom, but <i>London</i> particularly;
<i>viz.</i> all the inferior Trades, and
many others, that, according to the Custom
of associating together, we may consider as
forming one Division. Men, very valuable
in their Way, and of boundless Use to Society:
tho’ by the Wisdom of Providence
born rather to Labour than to Idleness; to
be obedient to the Laws, than to be the
Dispensers of them.</p>

<p>I am well aware that Difficulties will occur
to me on this Head, and thereby sometimes
break the Order of my Design; but,
as I have elsewhere observed, when Exceptions
from general Rules are reasonable, it
is perfectly right to adhere to them. It
would be Affectation in me to call myself
such a Stranger to the World, as not to
know the Influence of Money: Mankind is
apt to contract a Degree of Esteem for all
who possess it; and the Possessor seldom
fails to set a sufficient Value on himself for
it. Thus it often happens that Men, whose
Business is but mean, grow wealthy, have
perhaps an only Child, and think they have
a Right to educate it as they please; for my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
own Part I do not mean expressly to oppose
it, because it may be nipping a promising
Fruit in the Bud; but Parents of this Class
stand in need of more Knowledge to conduct
themselves herein than commonly
speaking they are possess’d of.</p>

<p>Nothing is more frequent than for Men
in different Stations to ruin themselves by
rashly aspiring; and he who has Reputation
and Credit in one Sphere, is perhaps
undone if he moves beyond it. But while
we see that Money is apt to make Men even
of good Understanding and good Education
giddy, no wonder that those of obscure
Birth, no Education, and a Life of ordinary
Employment, spent mostly in ordinary
Company, value themselves for their Possessions
far beyond Desert. To this is owing
that vain Strut, that supercilious Air,
and Contempt of others, so frequent in People
of this Class; and hence too arise those
Errors they daily commit, by an ostentatious
Education of their Children; by vainly
aspiring to equal their Betters, and often
to surpass them, at least in Appearance. I
had occasion, some Years ago, to make a
Visit to a young Lady of Fashion and Fortune
at one of our Boarding-Schools near
Town, where the best dress’d Girl in the
whole House was a Poulterer’s Daughter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
Can there be any thing more absurd than
this? yet is there any thing more common?
It is a general Observation, that ordinary
People dress their Children finer than People
of Fashion; and why? only because they
will shew the World they are able to do it,
and therefore will not be outdone. Parents
are not aware how destructive this false
Pride, this vain mistaken Fondness is to
their Children: and the first Effect it has on
them is, to make them ashamed of their Parents,
those very People who thus mislead
them. Can any thing be more preposterous
and unnatural? yet is it undeniably true.</p>

<p>There is an unhappy Propensity among
Mankind in general of being ashamed of
their poor and mean Relations, even among
the Good; it is a Spark of Pride very hard
to be extinguished, yet it may and ought to
be done. And considering that scarcely a
Family in the Kingdom is without them,
more or less, it is Matter of Surprise that
such Pains should be taken to stifle and conceal
them: especially too if we reflect how
much real Honour it does ourselves to cherish,
to countenance, and to espouse them.
Still it is true, that there is this Propensity,
this Weakness in Men, either from their
Nature, or their Education. Shall we then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
instead of keeping under this Pride in ourselves,
lead our Children into it too? shall
we deck them out so far above themselves
only to despise us? and to make them
falsely happy, make ourselves truly wretched?
nothing can be a greater Folly, and
nothing requires more the Parents Care to
avoid. I remember I once called to see a
Friend who was an Apothecary; a young
Fellow, my Friend’s Apprentice, was at
Work behind the Counter, and out peep’d
a laced Waistcoat. (I must observe it was
in those Days when a laced Waistcoat stood
for something, for it has now, I think, lost
all it’s Significance.) As the Appearance
was unusual, I enquired who that young
Gentleman was; and, to my great Surprise,
was informed he was the Son of a Coachman;
and the Lace he wore was taken off
his Father’s Livery. Thus what was before
no better than the Badge of Dependence, is
now turned into an Instrument of Contempt
and Ridicule. In how many of these things
do the Weakness and Folly of Parents appear?
would such a Boy own his Father on
the Coach-box? or would he not rather,
with an audacious Cock of his Hat, pass
contemptuously by him? nothing better
could be expected. And yet People who
take these Steps wonder their Children are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
not good; wonder they are proud, vain,
and untoward, when they themselves have
made them so.</p>

<p>Another Effect attending this misplaced
Indulgence, this false Education, besides the
making them ashamed of their Parents and
Relations, is, the Influence it has on the
Children’s future Lives: the Parents, it is
true, are often made wretched, but the
Children are not happy. Every thing raised
above itself is in a precarious tottering State;
the Building, whose Foundation is weak, is
every Day liable to fall; and the Man who
pretends to what he cannot maintain or support,
is in perpetual Danger of Ruin. Self-sufficiency
and Money may make his Outside
passable; but if he is all Meanness, all
Ignorance within, he can never procure a
Grain of Esteem, nor ever be solidly happy.
Children may in time discover their Parents
Mistakes and their own Misfortune, but
will then perhaps have no Remedy to apply.
Happy had it been for them had their Education
suited their Condition in Life; they
would then have laboured with honest
Chearfulness; and by keeping within their
proper Sphere, have had their Labours
crown’d with Success.</p>

<p>My Readers of this Class will, I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
afraid, be apt to mistake me, and think I
design to keep them in a low dependent
State; such an one as they call being unhappy;
far from it: I would not have undertaken
this Treatise at all, had I not designed
the real, the universal Good of Mankind.
Without Vanity I can say it, no one
has a more disinterested, a more general
Love of human Nature than myself; thousands
have superior Abilities, but few,
perhaps none, have superior good Wishes
for the Happiness of Society; and should
this very Performance prove a Trifle, the
Fault may be in my Head, but it is
not in my Heart: my Intention is good,
if my Power is weak. Let this then
serve as an Apology to all my Readers,
but let those of this Class in particular
be persuaded, that my Design is to augment
the Happiness of their Children, not
to lessen it. But then, they must resolve to
seek Happiness where it can be found; if
they wander into a Maze of Difficulties, and
get into a Sphere they are utter Strangers
to, they will most probably miss of it; but if
they confine themselves within their own
proper Orb, they need not fear to find it.
Still there is Reason to apprehend, that Men
of every Rank, and even among the lowest,
will value themselves not for what they are,
but for what they have; and while People<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
mistake Head for Brains, and Money for
Merit, the best Advice will often be useless.</p>

<p>But great as this Folly is, there is a
much greater reigning. Money, as I have
already observed, is extremely apt to intoxicate
Mankind; and it’s Influence is but too
visible both in high and low Life: but there
are thousands of this Class of People who
pride themselves in educating their Children
learnedly and expensively, without the
least Pretensions upon Earth. If a Gentleman
upon the Decay can get his Son educated
suitable to his Birth, Regard to his
Family, and Regard to his Education, may
obtain him a genteel and profitable Employment:
so too, if a Man in an inferior Station
is convinced he can purchase his Son a
Place or a Commission suitable to his superior
Education, there is certainly room to
justify him, tho’ we blame his Vanity; but
that People without the least Expectations,
that are conscious they cannot give their
Children a Shilling, who have not the Honour
of a Family to support, nor a Reputation
to maintain, should run these strange
Lengths, is amazing! The Truth is, Pride
and Ignorance are their Guides; they scorn
to be outdone by their Neighbours, tho’ all
the while they really don’t know what it is
they are doing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span></p>

<p>It is to be presumed that Children while
Children, and while educating, are in general
Strangers to what may be their future
Fortune on the part of their Parents: now
if they are taught to think themselves equal
to their Betters, taught to expect mighty
things, and at length find nothing, it is, I
think, a grievous Calamity on one side, and
gross Injustice on the other: and yet is this
evidently a daily Error.</p>

<p>The same things that yield us great
Good, are often productive of great Evil.
Food, designed by the Laws of Nature to
preserve Life and Health, is often made the
Instrument to destroy it. Education, designed
to lead us to Happiness, by enlarging
and improving our Understandings in
some certain Way, is often made the Instrument
of our Destruction. Hence appears
the Necessity of a temperate and a judicious
Use of both; and hence too we see, that
the Education suitable for one, is very
unfit for another. But I will now point
out what Education appears to me to be generally
proper for People of this Class; and
where solid Reasons make particular Exceptions
necessary, it is my Advice that Reason
take place of general Rules.</p>

<p>I will suppose then that my Readers design<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
with me the real Good of their Children;
and neither mean to neglect them,
nor to hazard their Ruin by overdoing
things. To this End Boys are to be taught
Reading, Writing, Arithmetic, and Drawing;
to which may be added, a Knowledge
of Maps. This Plan, tho’ comprized in a
few Words, contains all they need, nay all
they ought to learn. It is usual in the common
Businesses to put Boys Apprentice at
about fourteen Years old; now supposing
they begin to learn at seven, they have Work
enough cut out for seven Years at least;
which if well attended to, and their Time be
well employed, is capable of turning to great
account. I mean not to give offence to any
one, but as the Province I am engaged in
obliges me to speak my Thoughts, I may
offend without Intention: and honest Truth,
in a Matter of this Importance, is not to be
disguised. My Advice then is, that Boys
of this Class never once attempt to learn
<i>Latin</i>. What do they want with it? or
what use can they make of it? will it enable
a Man to make better Shoes? will it assist a
Taylor in cutting out a Coat? or will it
give a Barber a keener Edge to his Razor?
Parents, when they send a Boy to School,
are often guided by the Master what he
shall learn; he, naturally fond of advancing
his Scholar, puts him into <i>Latin</i>; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
thinks him shabby without it. But is it not
possible that this Gentleman may be a Man
of real Merit, a good Grammarian, nay a
compleat classic Scholar, yet a very bad
Judge of Life? most certainly. The Boy
is thrust headlong into things he does not
want, and neither Parents nor Master consider
the End: for tho’ it is certain that Parents
cannot always tell what their Children
will be, yet those of this Class are pretty
sure they want not deep Learning.</p>

<p>Of all the Mistakes committed in Education,
none is equal to that of our being
thrust into an Employment for which we
are unqualified; especially too if it be one
of a serious important Nature; now no People
on Earth are so liable to this as the Class
we are treating of; for as they are apt to
take a Remove beyond themselves for profound
Knowledge, they plunge their Children
into a Labyrinth of Difficulties, by engaging
them in a Profession or Science far
beyond their Power to reach.</p>

<p>I have already urged, that, in the Case
before us, a learned Education is needless
and improper; but this is saying too little
of it, and treating it too mildly: we may
go farther, and shew that it is even hurtful,
by being an Impediment to more useful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
Knowledge: and farther still, that it is not
always what it is taken for. A Boy in common
Life has perhaps about seven Years Schooling;
the greatest Part whereof is employed
in learning <i>Latin</i>: his <i>English</i> is notoriously
neglected; and Writing and Arithmetic he
gains but imperfectly. Now I beg leave to
ask, whether these three last are not more
useful to a Boy of this Stamp than <i>Latin</i>?
and whether it is not a Misfortune to spend
his Time in gaining what he has no use for,
and omitting what he wants? But it is an
Error in me to call it gaining, when in Reality
it is losing: for after a Boy has been
puzling his poor Brains, and been tortured
with <i>Latin</i> for several Years, it is ten to one
that, comparatively speaking, he knows nothing:
that is, nothing radical, and to the
Bottom; nothing, in short, but what one
Year’s Apprenticeship will entirely efface.
As a Proof that this is no Exaggeration,
losing Learning is not only the Fate of Boys
in common Life, who seldom get more than
a Smattering, but it is confessed by every
Gentleman, by the deepest Scholars, that a
long Disuse of a Language, or almost any
Branch of Learning, will in great measure
wear it out of our Memories: or at least
take off that Facility which constitutes Perfection.
A Relation of mine was sent to
<i>London</i> some Years ago to be educated fit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
for Business; a Friend had the Care of him;
who, after sending him to learn Reading,
Writing, and Accompts for some Time, resolved
to compleat him by putting him for
a Year to <i>Merchant-Taylors</i> School to learn
<i>Latin</i>. He did so; and that finished, he
was put Apprentice to a Cabinet-maker.
But what availed his <i>Latin</i>? just nothing.
In three Months time he saw’d and planed
it all away; he was not a Pin the better for
it; but he lost a Year of precious Time,
that might have been very usefully employed
in improving what he had before learn’d,
and in applying himself to Drawing: a thing
absolutely necessary for the very Business he
was put to, and which, to my own Knowledge,
he has often lamented the Want of.
Now this is not a single Instance, an accidental
Mistake, but a general Error; hundreds
and thousands of which might be every
day produced: the Consequences whereof
are always more or less wrong, and sometimes
very fatal.</p>

<p>I have observed that useful things are neglected,
to run in pursuit of what to them is
useless; that is, they leave a certain Good
for a precarious one. But we may reason
still farther on this Head with great Utility.
Mankind is by Nature aspiring and ambitious;
and where Wisdom and Prudence
accompany our Steps herein, they are highly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
laudable. But if, instead of these, Ignorance
and Vanity are our Guides, we are
pretty sure of going wrong. A Man of
mean Extraction, and illiterate, takes these
mistaken Steps already pointed out, in
bringing up his Son; whence a false Pride
is stamped on both, and is sure to increase
with the Boy’s Learning. The Father’s
Care is to keep his Boy from disgracing his
Education. “<i>Jack</i>, (says he) I have bestowed
Learning on you, to make you a
Man; look forward, and I don’t fear but
you will make your Fortune.” And the
Son at the same time takes care to think
himself a better Man than his Father. But
let us conduct him on; he is now a Gentleman;
because he has, or fancies he has,
Learning. He must dress fine, and keep
Company with his Betters; this leads him to
Expences he cannot afford; no matter, he is a
Gentleman, and must appear like one. His
Father, after rumaging his Brains for a
genteel Employment, at length puts his Son
to an Attorney. But that’s a dull Life, he
likes the Stage better; and after having seen
Plays by the hundred, he concludes himself
equal to any thing, and turns Player:
where perhaps his highest Character is to
speak the Prologue in <i>Hamlet</i>’s mock Play,
or to be the rueful Apothecary in <i>Romeo
and Juliet</i>. It is too well known what kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
of Lives these Gentlemen lead; they are
mostly riotous, extravagant, miserable, and
short. Now can it be denied that these, and
such as these, are the fatal Consequences of
this false Education? surely daily Experience
convinces us it cannot. But as I labour for
the public Good, so I desire to do the strictest
Justice. I will grant then that a Boy of
this Stamp, and thus trained, does all on
his Part to advance himself; that he is prudent,
temperate, and virtuous; still he has
neither Bottom, Interest, nor Friends; it is
an hundred, perhaps a thousand to one, if he
arrives at any thing higher than being a
Hackney-Writer, an Usher to a School, or
at most the slavish Master of an insignificant
one.</p>

<p>Permit me here a short Digression. There
are no People in the World, whom I at the
same time both honour and pity, so much
as Schoolmasters and Preceptors; those particularly
to whom we owe the most essential,
the most solid Part of our Education.
There is something strangely inconsistent in
Mankind, or they could not see a Master
incessantly slave, and toil, and sweat to instruct
others, and leave him at last without
Reward. The Man who is qualified for a
Teacher, must have laboured many Years
in the Pursuit of Knowledge. If we would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
wish this Man to do Justice to our Sons, we
certainly should do Justice to him; that is,
we should prove, at the same time that we
desire our Children to be made wise, that
we have so much Gratitude as to make him
happy, by rewarding him as he deserves.
From this ungrateful Disposition, or, from
a very misplaced Frugality, it often happens
that Parents do not seek the best Teachers,
but the cheapest; whence not only follow
the fatal Consequences attending a bad Education,
by a seeming one passing for real,
but also that many, who are by no means
qualified, undertake the important Task.
To return then to my Subject, we cannot
doubt but that some of these unqualified
Teachers are the Fruits of this false Education
we have been speaking of; Men, who
tho’ unequal to the Task they are engaged
in, would have been distinguished as eminent
Proficients in another Way, and been
very valuable to Society; while in this, the
highest Honour they arrive at, is perhaps
the holding forth with a dictatorial Air in
an Ale-house.</p>

<p>Many are the evil Effects this false Education
produces; for thro’ the Mistakes of
Parents, the Pride of Children shews itself
very early, and daily gathers Strength: they
soon look down with Scorn and Contempt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
on the mean Business of their Father; and
soon aspire to what they have not the least
Chance to reach. But as they have been
injudiciously taught to aspire, we cannot
greatly wonder at their mistaken Conduct:
hence we see them spending their Lives not
merely in Trifles, but in Riot, Extravagancies,
and Debauchery: averse to Employment,
averse to Labour; too learned to be
industrious, too ignorant to be wise. But
how much happier would they be to know
themselves, and keep within that Self-knowledge!
How sweet is that Bread which is
earn’d with honest Industry! How much
happier is the Man that labours at his
Loom, than he who with mistaken Pride,
despising it, is perhaps reduced to be dependent
on others! Could then Parents in
general of this Rank, but learn Content in
their Stations, and keep their Children from
soaring beyond their Reach, they would secure
much Comfort to both, besides contributing
to the Happiness of Posterity.</p>

<p>My Readers will remember that the
Scheme of Education for Boys of this Class,
is Reading, Writing, Arithmetic, Drawing,
and a Knowledge of Maps. I will now
shew what Advantage may be made of these,
and endeavour to prove, that this is so far
from being a contemptible Education, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
when attained to Perfection, it is not only
useful, but very extensively so.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Addison</i> says, that every Man who
reasons is a Logician, tho’ he has never studied
the Rules of Logic: so too we may
say, that every Man who speaks grammatically
is a Grammarian, tho’ he has not been
taught Grammar. What I here mean is,
that a due Attention to Children, and proper
Instructions with regard to <i>English</i> only,
will enable them to make a very considerable
Figure both in Reading and Speaking.
Nature furnishes us with the Faculty of
Speech, but the Mode of it in great measure
depends on the Place we are born
in, and the Language we are accustomed
to hear. The Court, and the learned Part
of a Nation, certainly speak the purest Language;
the Vulgar and the Illiterate speak
the coarsest, and the most corrupt: but
there are many Degrees between, who may
be said to have the Power of choosing, as
they frequently hear both. It is then the
Parents Business to be greatly attentive in
this important Point; especially as Experience
shews us that a great Man can be
vulgar, and a little one polite, and the Medium
can neglect the Advantages in his
Power by adhering to the wrong Side, when
with equal Ease he may attain the right. I
have already cautioned the Great never to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
sink beneath their Quality; and while they
learn to be humble, they must carefully
avoid being mean. I have also recommended
to the Gentry to approach as near to the
Quality in good Behaviour and polite Language
as possible: and to those of this Class,
I strongly urge, that every thing coarse,
vulgar, and incorrect, is not only improper,
but highly unbecoming; is not only abusing
the Faculties Providence has furnished them
with, but is debasing their Nature. If then
the Parents of this Class enter upon the
Education of their Children with just Reflections
(which all, more or less, are capable of
making) the natural Consequence will be,
that they will seek such Methods as are most
conducive to their acquiring a thorough
Knowledge of their Mother-tongue.</p>

<p>It may be urged that a compleat Knowledge
of the <i>English</i> cannot be acquired without
<i>Latin</i>; but, with all due Respect, I beg
leave to dissent from this: I have seen a
good <i>Latin</i> Scholar greatly deficient in the
Knowledge of <i>English</i>, and a very correct
<i>Englishman</i> who did not know a Word of
<i>Latin</i>. But nice grammatical Rules are not
strictly the Province of Boys in common
Life, and much may be done without them.
A good Master will enable them to read in
a very expressive and significant Manner, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
the same time that he makes them acquainted
with his Subject. He will teach them
the different Types, why a <i>Roman</i>, why an
<i>Italic</i> Letter is used; where the Accent is to be
laid on different Words, and on the same
Word in different Senses; where capital
Letters are to be used, and why; the different
Stops, which we call Pointing, and
their Force; the Cadence, or Falling of the
Voice, in ending a Sentence, or a Paragraph;
and, what is the greatest Beauty of
all, where to lay the Emphasis or Stress on
every Expression, so as to give it it’s utmost
Energy. Farther, he will teach his
Scholars to keep close to Nature; and not
suffer them to borrow a Whine, a Tone of
Voice from that almost universal Destroyer
of Nature, Affectation. He will shew them
that the only thing which can be granted in
this Case, is a certain adjusting, or rather a
little Elevation of the Voice in Reading,
above Speaking; and that they come nearest
to true Reading, who would be supposed to
be Speaking, were a blind Man the Hearer.
He will shew too, that, according to Nature,
all Subjects do not require equal Energy in
Reading; and consequently the Voice must
be modify’d and varied, on suitable Occasions:
for as we are susceptible of various
Impressions; and as Joy, Grief, Anger,
and other Passions, are differently expressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
by us without any previous Study, purely
from the Force of Nature, so a good Master
will shew, that a Prayer, a History, and a
Poem, have each something different in
their Nature; and that to give them their due
Propriety, Force, and Beauty, each must
be read in a different way. Besides these,
the Master will shew his Scholars, that in
order to speak to Perfection they must observe
first, what Language their Betters
speak, and by comparing it with that of the
Vulgar, they will be enabled to distinguish,
not only good from bad, but Propriety
from Impropriety; whence they will insensibly
learn, Gender, Number, and Case;
Person, Mood, and Tense, with many
other things relating to Grammar, without
once supposing that they are acquiring
them. Secondly, he will direct them in
the Choice of such Books as will give a
double Relish to Reading, by the Goodness
of the Language they are wrote in. And
lastly, he will recommend their seeking Opportunities
of hearing their Betters read,
that they may compleat by Imitation, what
Instruction has laid the Foundation of.</p>

<p>But to give all the Satisfaction in my
Power, I beg leave to observe, that as
Grammar (if I may be allow’d the Expression)
is the Soul of every Language, it may,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
in essential Matters, be taught in <i>English</i> as
well as in <i>Latin</i>: it is true, that, in compound
Words, and some of the Derivations,
both <i>Latin</i> and <i>Greek</i> are necessary, and indeed
many other Languages; but they are
only so for Gentlemen and professed Scholars;
and tho’ a mere <i>English</i> Scholar cannot
give all the Derivations of Words, yet
he can give all the Meanings, and all, or
most of their Rules; and thereby be enabled
to acquire a considerable Degree of Perfection,
a pretty thorough Knowledge of his
Own Language; and sometimes a Knowledge
superior to those who in other respects
are superior Scholars. Should it still be
urged, that if Boys learn <i>Latin</i>, a Knowledge
of <i>English</i> will be a necessary Consequence,
and that Grammar in <i>Latin</i> is
Grammar in <i>English</i>; I am ready to grant
it: but the Point here maintained is, that
what is called a learned Education is unnecessary
and often hurtful to Boys of this
Class, nor have they Time to acquire it.
Besides, there are always Difficulties in referring
or applying grammatical Niceties
from one Language to another; Difficulties
which are not within the Province of every
one to get over. If therefore Boys of this
Class, instead of engaging in <i>Latin</i>, which,
as has been shewn, they have not Time to
acquire, nor in general have any use for it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
if they did, would apply to the Study of
<i>English</i> only, and make the most of that,
they may improve to a great Degree; vastly
more than is usually done, because prevented
by an injudicious Application to the
<i>Latin</i>.</p>

<p>Thus much have I said, in some measure
to do Honour to the Language of my own
Country; but chiefly with a View to remove
the Errors too generally run into by
inferior People, partly from their Vanity,
and partly from their being Strangers to the
many and great Advantages which this
Branch of Education only is capable of affording.
I know that innocent well-meaning
People are often misled in educating
their Children; and have heard many say,
that a Boy must learn <i>Latin</i> to enable him
to spell <i>English</i>; but this is a vulgar Error,
and henceforward, I hope, will be removed.
But yet farther to prove the Usefulness of
our Language in the real Concerns of Life,
we may add, that by this alone may be
learnt, from those whose Province it is to
teach, every Duty, every Obligation we
owe to God and Man; by this we are enabled
to read the sacred Writings; by this
we can become acquainted not only with
the History of all <i>Europe</i>, both ancient and
modern, but of the whole World; and particularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
with the History of our own Country:
by this we are furnished with Books
containing Helps in Building, Planting,
Gardening, and many other things of great
Use to Mankind; and by this, in a word,
we are furnished with vast Abundance of
both Instruction and Delight; not only from
the excellent Translations from <i>Latin</i>, <i>Greek</i>,
<i>Spanish</i>, <i>Italian</i>, <i>French</i>, &amp;c. but from the
original Writings of many of our own
Countrymen: Men, whose Geniuses were
perhaps inferior to none. Here, without
Flourish, Parade, or Exaggeration, my
Readers will see how noble an Use may be
made of our Mother-tongue; how much
Pleasure it will yield us, how much Knowledge
it will convey to us; and hence, I
hope, Parents will be induced to consider it
in the Light it deserves.</p>

<p>Boys are next to engage in Writing; and
I earnestly recommend that it be closely attended
to, and considered as a Matter of
great Importance. The present Method of
teaching, and the Kind of Hand now usually
wrote in Business is, I think, admirable;
the Merchants of <i>London</i>, and some of our
public Offices, shew great Perfection in this
Way; and I would recommend that every
Boy both learn and practise a mercantile
Hand, as it is at the same time useful and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
beautiful. Every Man who is acquainted
with Life must daily see the too general Defects
of Hand-writing. If a Bricklayer, or
any other Workman, brings in a Bill, what
a pitiful Figure it makes; nay, it is sometimes
so very bad, that none but the Writer
himself can read it; and where we see one
wrote out in a masterly Way, it is ten to
one but he has, at considerable Expence,
employed somebody to do it for him. Now
this must surely be considered as a grievous
Misfortune, both as it is an Inconvenience,
and a Loss; and which ought carefully to
be prevented in the rising Generation. Besides,
if we reflect on the unforeseen Advantages
which many meet with who are
fine Penmen, we shall be convinced how
necessary it is to excel in this Art.</p>

<p>We come now to Arithmetic, which includes
a large Field of Knowledge. The
Use of Figures, is so universally known and
allowed, that it seems needless to urge any
thing in their Favour. Men of all Degrees
want their Aid; they are the first Introduction
to the Mathematics; and the Knowledge
of them is more or less necessary from
the Prince to the Peasant. If a Man fails in
<i>Holland</i>, they immediately say, he has not
kept good Accounts; in Truth People of
almost every Rank stand in need of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
Help; and their Use and Power thoroughly
known and attended to, would preserve
thousands from Ruin. Parents then cannot
do too much to instruct their Children
in this important Branch of Knowledge;
especially if they consider on one hand the
Confusion and Perplexity which attends the
Ignorance of it, and on the other hand the
many surprising Turns for the Advancement
of their Fortune, when possessed of the
Knowledge of it. All young People, as I
have before recommended, should be taught
Method, and nothing more likely to initiate
them in it than a masterly Knowledge of
Figures. Besides, Debtor and Creditor,
Loss and Gain, are by no means confined
to the Merchant; every Man, however low
his Trade, or however narrow his Dealings,
while he does trade or deal, should understand
what he is about: and he has no
other Way than this of attaining that necessary
Knowledge. I am very sensible, that
some Men, even in Trade, have got thro’
the World, and make good Acquisitions,
without any considerable Degree of this
Kind of Knowledge; but we may truly say
of such, that Fortune stood so very near
them, that they stumbled upon her: tho’,
for one who has thus succeeded, a thousand
have miscarried. But my Aim is, to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
the rising Generation so educated, that either
Misfortunes may be prevented, or, if they
do come, that their own Conduct may be
irreproachable: and, I say again, no way
more likely to effect this, than knowing
thoroughly and attending closely to Figures.
But farther, this and the foregoing Branch
of Knowledge are strong Recommendations
in various Stations of Life: many, even
from nothing, have by these Qualifications
become great Merchants; our <i>East-India</i>
and other Companies frequently want Boys
who write and account in a masterly Way;
and when young People set out in the
World and act for themselves, the Knowledge
of their Affairs, from their Skill in
Figures, is often a Restraint upon them,
and a Curb to their Passions; by keeping
them from what they see they cannot afford.</p>

<p>I shall now speak of that important, tho’
much neglected Branch of Knowledge, Drawing.
It is matter of Surprise to me that a thing
so obviously useful, and in many Respects
so indispensably necessary, should be so generally
disregarded. Young Gentlemen at
an Academy indeed sometimes learn a little
Drawing; but neither so often, nor so compleatly
as they ought; but it is not of those
I now mean to speak, but of that large Body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
of Youth comprehended in the fourth Class
of People.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> As Parents cannot know certainly
what their Children will be, it is fit
that, according to their Station, they should
be so educated, as to be prepared for whatever
may suit their Circumstances, their
Capacity, and their Inclinations: to this
End, besides Reading, Writing, and Arithmetic,
I earnestly recommend Drawing. To
prove it’s Use, let us first view the various
Branches of Building; where we shall immediately
see the Necessity of understanding
it. It is my Advice to all Parents,
without Exception, that they implant in
their Children an ardent Desire to excel; not
to engage them in things they are unequal
to, not to fill their Heads with Chimeras of
fancied Power and Abilities, but that they
labour with unwearied Industry to become
perfect in their Way, be their Profession,
Trade, or Business what it will. Thus, if
a Boy is to be a Bricklayer, a Carpenter, a
Smith, or any other Trade relating to
Building, it is right that he should be animated
with a Desire to become perfect, and
not sit down contented with a scanty, superficial
Knowledge of his Business: and, to attain
this, Drawing should be made as familiar
to him as Writing; which would greatly
tend to his Advancement in the World: for
how often does it happen that a Gentleman
wants his own Conceptions and Designs explained
and improved; which are easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
done by a masterly Workman, but are entangled
and made worse by a Blunderer.
Drawing shews us the Difference between
Beauty and Deformity; as Features, Mein,
Aspect, Stature, and the Power of Light
and Shade. It teaches us the Use of Lines,
Angles, Squares, and Circles; it teaches us
the Rules of Proportion, what Base is proper
for an Edifice of different Dimensions;
what constitutes a regular, what an irregular
Building; it distinguishes true Taste from
false; it assists our Fancy, and enlivens our
Imagination; it is the Foundation of Architecture,
and therefore necessary for every
Branch of Building: for tho’ there are general
Rules and Principles in each Order
of Building, yet is there great Latitude for
what we call Fancy, Taste, and Judgment:
and thus the whole Beauty and Propriety of
an Edifice may be said to depend on the artful
blending of the several Orders into one
perfect Superstructure.</p>

<p>Thus much for the Usefulness of Drawing
in Building; but I should injure this
Art if I stop’d here, for it is still far more
extensive. It is not enough that a Gentleman
builds himself a House, it must be furnish’d
too; and if he be a Man of Fortune
and Taste, he will not be contented with
what is merely useful, but will add the ornamental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
likewise: hence appears the Necessity
of the Artificers in this Way learning to
draw in order to excel. If an Upholsterer
be sent for, it is an Advantage to him not
only to give the proper Dimensions of Furniture,
but to display the several Ornaments
and Fancies in use, and even strike out new
Designs of his own; that he may convince
People he is a Master in his Way: he cannot
shew a Piece of Damask or printed Linen,
but the Draughtsman appears in it; and it
is right that he should be equally knowing
in his own Business.</p>

<p>But if we take a more general Survey of
things, in order to give us a true and solid
Estimation of real Life, we shall find this
Art of surprising Use. How many Trades
are there subservient to the Arts and
Sciences? all those who make Maps, Charts,
and Globes; all those who make mathematical
Instruments, and the vast Apparatus
for the different Parts of Experimental Philosophy;
so too Engravers, Sculptors,
Painters, and Anatomists; all these, with
many others, needless to enumerate, stand in
need of Drawing: So vast is it’s Use, and
so necessary is the Knowledge of it!</p>

<p>The last Step of Education for Boys of
this Class is Geography, or the Knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
of Maps. Geography makes us acquainted
with the whole Surface of the Earth; the
whole terraqueous Globe: it is first divided
into Quarters, viz. <i>Europe</i>, <i>Asia</i>, <i>Africa</i>,
and <i>America</i>; again, these Quarters are subdivided,
so as to make us acquainted with
particular Provinces, Kingdoms, States, and
Empires: hence it is easy to see the Pleasure
and Use that arises from this Knowledge.
Men of every Rank are liable to
leave their native Country; and indeed it is
often the only Way to their Advancement.
What a Pleasure then must it be to be acquainted
with a Road we never saw? to travel
in a Country without Pain from our
Fore-knowledge of it? which is really the
Case with an Adept in Geography. But
supposing our Travels exceed not the Bounds
of our own Country; it is a Subject of great
Delight to be thoroughly acquainted with
that. Or farther yet: supposing we do not
travel at all; Geography has still it’s Use:
it assists us in the Knowledge of History,
and thereby adds Instruction and Pleasure to
our Reading: in fine, it makes us acquainted
with the whole World, without going out
of our Closets.</p>

<p>My Readers are, I hope, by this time
convinced, how advantageous these Steps of
Education are for many of the Purposes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
Life; nay they are such as some in better
Stations are in great measure Strangers to,
tho’ they may be possessed of Qualifications
otherwise useful. If then to this be added
virtuous Dispositions, a docile Mind, a becoming
Behaviour, and, in a word, that
genuine Manners recommended to all, I
think Parents in general of this Class may
promise themselves much more Comfort in
their Children than they usually find.</p>

<p>Girls too of this Class are capable of being
very valuable; but again I must caution
Parents to be aware of those Banes of Happiness,
Idleness, Pride, and Vanity. Idleness
is justly called the Root of all Evil;
and Pride and Vanity are empty nothings:
or if they can be said to produce any thing,
it is Evil. Girls of this Class have many
things within their Reach, and if well attended
to, may attain them. They may
read and write to great Advantage; and
learn so much of Accompts as will be necessary
for conducting their Concerns, and
understanding those Affairs they may in future
Life be engaged in. They may and
ought to work to Perfection, but principally
the useful Parts: and tho’ the ornamental is
highly commendable, yet it must not here
be encouraged to the Prejudice or Neglect
of the useful. When this Foundation is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
solidly laid, let them be carefully instructed
in the Management of a House, according
to what has already been observed in the
foregoing Class; from whence they will receive
such a Fund of useful Knowledge, as
when joined with good Demeanour, will
procure them not only the Esteem of their
Equals, but that of their Superiors. Let
Parents farther inspire them with Dispositions
daily to improve their Minds; to
maintain with firmest Resolution the nicest
Innocence, even amidst the rudest Attacks,
should they occur to them; and lastly, to support
themselves with a chearful Mind in that
State which is allotted them. In fact, Happiness
is much more within their Reach than they
commonly imagine; but if they neglect to
consider the Advantages they enjoy beyond
thousands who are beneath them, and anxiously
dwell on the Splendor of those above
them, it is the certain way never to find it.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding what has been said on
this Class, Allowances are still to be made
as Circumstances vary; and if the Plan be
in general practicable, it is all that can be
expected. Education is in some measure
accidental; and it is right to embrace those
Advantages which Accident offers, provided
they do not interfere with more useful
Knowledge, for then they are no Advantages.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
For Example: nobody should neglect their
Mother-tongue; yet if they are so situated
that they can add <i>French</i> to it, they ought
by all means to do so. In the preceding
Classes <i>French</i> is considered as a necessary
Part of Education chiefly from it’s Politeness,
and the Advantage of reading <i>French</i> Authors;
but according to the present Age it is
far more useful. <i>French</i> is now so universal,
that a Man who speaks it can do Business with
whatever Foreigner comes in his Way; or
should he go abroad, he can transact his Affairs
in any Country, or on any Exchange
in <i>Europe</i>. But it is still farther necessary.
<i>Moliere</i>, in one of his Comedies, introduces
a Conversation, where a Servant is accused
of flattering his Master: “What can I do?
replies he: I am to please, I am to secure
my Service by keeping in his good
Graces, and I have no other way of doing
it: therefore, continues he, it is not
the Fault of me who flatter, but of him
who will be flattered.” So in taking a
View of Life we may sometimes observe,
that to secure the Interest and Favour of the
Great, the Taylor, the Milliner, the Shoe-maker,
and many others, are expected to
introduce their Modes under a <i>French</i>
Tongue. But to do justice to the Wisdom
of our Nation, this is far from being general;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
therefore a general and close Application
to the <i>French</i> for the fourth Class does not
seem either necessary or practicable; because
to some it would be useless, in others it
would be forgot again, and by many it
would never be attained.</p>

<p>Another Part of Education which is
oftentimes merely accidental, is Music. If
a Man plays on any Instrument, it will be
delightful to him to employ his Son’s leisure
Time in giving him something of so
agreeable an Accomplishment; or if he can
improve his Daughter’s Ear or Voice, by
giving her a pleasing Manner in Singing,
she should not be deprived of it; for these
things make young People sprightly in
themselves, and pleasing to others. But
then Care must be taken that they stop
here: they must not engage in an expensive
and laborious Study of Music, unless it is
to be their Trade; nor must they be attached
to it so as to neglect other Obligations,
or so as to engage them in irregular
Company: and above all, great Care must
be taken that they be not tainted by that
Torrent of Corruption, bad Songs.</p>

<p>There is indeed a Step of Education for
this Class, as well as all the preceding,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
which I think of Importance, could it
be obtained without the usual Inconveniencies
attending it; that is, Dancing. I consider
Dancing as conducive to Health; I
consider it as sometimes a Means of preventing
Deformity; and where there is no
danger of that, all must see that it is the
great Means of making young People of
both Sexes stand, and walk, and sit, and
even look and speak to advantage. Mr.
<i>Locke</i>, speaking of a docile Mind, and good
Dispositions, as superior to every other
Consideration, says, “Parents surely must
have a strange Affection for <i>Latin</i> and
<i>Greek</i>, who will prefer them to their Sons
Virtue.” So too I may say of Dancing;
if we cannot get the Good without the Bad,
it is better to let it alone. First, it is, for a
great many People, too expensive; nothing
indeed to those of Fortune, and in great
Business; but to others, more so than is
convenient. Next, it is apt to inflame
young People’s Vanity, as well as increase
the Expence of their Apparel. A Boy who
learns to Dance is dissatisfied unless he
has Pumps, white Stockings, laced Hat,
and many other things not necessary to his
Station; and a Girl rejoices when the dancing
Days come, only because she is to have
her Silk Coat on. A third Objection is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
the Danger of their contracting a Passion
for Dancing; for tho’ young People may
sometimes very innocently divert themselves
with an Evening Ball or a Country Dance,
yet an eager Desire for these Engagements,
especially to those of lower Rank, and to
those who live in <i>London</i>, are extremely dangerous.
Still, as this Qualification seems
really necessary, if the Expence of the Master
can be submitted to, the other Difficulties
may, I think, be got over. But here the
Manners are concerned: Children must
obey, and wear without a Struggle, and
without a Blush, such Apparel as their Parents
judge fit for them. If besides this,
they are made sensible that every Step in
their Education is taken purely for their
Good, and are carefully instructed never to
abuse by an inordinate Attachment what is
bestowed on them only for Use; if Parents
I say do this, they may in general hope that
all their Children learn will turn to good
account.</p>

<p>The Province I am engaged in, and the
tender Regard I pay to all human Nature,
demands that I speak of a fifth Class of
People, usually term’d the Peasantry: tho’ I
think the principal thing to be done here, is
to admonish those in higher Spheres to behave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
with Justice and Humanity to them,
rather than to address themselves. If we
speak of Education, here it will naturally carry
our Ideas to the Spade, the Plough, or the
Team; and which may without Impropriety
be called Education to them. It is a true
Saying, that there is a right way and a
wrong in doing every thing; if so, it is an
useful Part of Education to instruct them
how to till the Earth with greatest Ease to
themselves, and with greatest Profit to those
who employ them. As early and constant
Labour is the Province of this Class, there
is but a small Share either of Time or Abilities
for Instruction; still as they are by
Nature susceptible of it, those who have
Power cannot employ it better than by bestowing
it; so far at least as may open their
Minds to distinguish Truth from Falsehood,
Right from Wrong, Innocence from Guilt.
If to this were added, at least the Power of
reading their Mother-tongue, it would at
times be an Entertainment and a Consolation
to them; and it would remove, in some
Degree, that total Darkness and Ignorance
they must otherwise remain in.</p>

<p>But here, for the Sake of Instruction, I
must depart from the strict Propriety of the
Word <i>Peasant</i>, to touch on another Species<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
of Rustics; that is, those of the lowest Class
of People, in <i>London</i> particularly. These
People possess indeed the Ignorance of the
Peasants, but they seldom equal them in
Innocence. Many are abandoned to every
Vice; many indeed are honest and industrious;
but even among those who are themselves
good, their Children, thro’ an early
false Fondness, or the Corruption of others,
are usually ignorant, untoward, and vicious.
Whence we daily see and hear in the open
Streets such things as are Insults on Mankind;
such as must shock the Ears, and
make the Heart tremble; and such as cannot
but be a Reflection on any civilized Nation.
We say, it is easier to obey than govern;
and, in this Case, it is perhaps easier
to propose a Remedy, than to put it in Execution.
But to cure an Evil among the
Little, we must address ourselves to the
Great; for if they have either their Example
or Countenance, all Attempts to remedy it
are fruitless. Next we must turn our Eyes
on those in Power, as Magistrates, and
Men in Office; if these exercise their Authority
with Justice and Fidelity, much may
be done: but if they not only neglect this,
but give ill Example too, little is to be expected.
Thirdly, the Children of these
People are to have some Degree of Education;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
the Boys, Reading, Writing, and the
first Rules in Arithmetic at least; which, if
carefully taught them, will qualify them for
many useful Employments. The Girls should
at least read and work at their Needle. But
all this, tho’ indispensably necessary, is too
weak to effect the Purpose designed. The
Perverseness of the Will, the Unruliness of
the Head, and the Corruption of the Heart,
are still to be conquered. Manners alone
then is the effectual Remedy: and as, to
cure a Disease, we must strike at the Root
of it; so, to rectify the Morals and Misbehaviour
of the Corrupt, we must, on solid
Principles of Reason and Reflection, awaken
the Mind, and regulate the Heart.</p>

<h2>CONCLUSION.</h2>

<p>A Citizen of <i>Athens</i> advising with <i>Xenophon</i>
about whither he should send his
Son for Education, It is my Counsel, answered
<i>Xenophon</i>, that you send him to
<i>Sparta</i>. To <i>Sparta</i>! says the <i>Athenian</i>; is
rude and uncultivated <i>Sparta</i> then preferable
to <i>Athens</i>, the Seat of Arts and Sciences?
Yes, replies the Sage: at <i>Sparta</i> he will
learn a Science worth all the rest, he will
learn to obey. According to this Philosopher
then, Obedience alone is a Science productive
of every useful Knowledge; whereas,
without it, all other human Knowledges
are often useless, if not, in general, dangerous
Acquisitions.</p>

<p>Certain it is, that much may be hoped
from setting out right, and every thing is to
be feared from a wrong Beginning. Parents
therefore who aim at making their Children
wise, should aim at previously making them
good. That is, (to recapitulate the chief of
what has been said) they must make their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
Wills pliant and tractable, by teaching them
an early, very early Obedience: next, they
should mould their Hearts, imprint on them
a Love of Truth, Honour, Justice, and
every other Virtue: lastly, they should
form their Minds and Manners, by shewing
them the several Duties of their Station,
and how to fulfil them.</p>

<p>The first Duties of Children are in great
measure mechanical: an obedient Child
makes a Bow, comes and goes, speaks, or
is silent, just as he is bid, before he knows
any other Reason for so doing than that he is
bid: the Dawn of Reason shews him general
Duties; that is, that he owes to his Parents
and Guides Obedience, Respect, and
Love: when his Mind is farther opened,
and his Judgment has gained Strength, he
sees (if led by faithful Teachers) that he is
born for an important, nobly important
Purpose; and tho’ many particular Obligations,
which he was before a Stranger to,
present themselves to his View, yet is he
convinced that they are nothing but what,
under Reason’s Sway, he is capable of answering.
Farther, he sees that the Exercise
of all moral Obligations are rendered light
by being reciprocal; and from a Sense that
his own Support, Comfort, and Happiness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
requires the Aid of others, he chearfully
and willingly labours for others. Lastly,
he sees, that tho’ irregular Passions sometimes
raise Tumults in the Soul, and
struggle for the Mastery, yet from the Happiness
of a well-tempered Heart, the constant
Exercise of Reason, and the Reflection
he must needs make on the daily Instances
before him of Vice punished and of Virtue
rewarded, he may not only be enabled to
give Virtue the Ascendant, but to give it on
the purest Motive; that is, for the Love of
Virtue. All this, I say, unless Children
are by Nature untractable, or are over-powered
by the Torrent of corrupt Example,
will generally be the Effect of well-regulated
Manners: and, possessed of all
this, who can doubt but that they will then
be wise? or who can think that while thus
much is wanting they ever can be wise?</p>

<p>Mankind, as has been observed before,
naturally desire their Children’s Prosperity
and Happiness; but if they seek it in any
other Road than this, they must not wonder
if they miss of it: rather may they wonder
in good earnest, if they ever find it. Still
is the ultimate Point untouched: for, besides
that our Passions are to be regulated,
and our Actions to be innocent in themselves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
and valuable to others; to make
them perfect, they are farther to be animated
by a right Intention: for, says a learned
and ingenious Author, “the Intention is
the Pulse of the Soul.” Many Actions,
in themselves indifferent, are rendered hurtful
by an Error in the Intention; and even
those which seem calculated by Nature to
produce the most signal Advantages to
others, as well as to us, are often, for want
of being properly directed to their right
End, both fruitless to those they were designed
to benefit, and even detrimental to
ourselves. Here then we are to know, that
moral Duties are of divine Origin; and if
Nature shews us the first Laws of Right and
Wrong, the Author of Nature implanted
them in us. But our Obligations to the
<span class="smcap">great Creator</span> of us all will irresistably
appear; if we duly survey ourselves and
every thing around us; for as thence we
shall see that from Him alone we receive all
things, so thence shall we be convinced that
to Him alone all should be referred. Thus
it is evident, that to fill up the Measure of
our Duty, three things are necessary: first,
we are to be carefully informed what is
Right, and what is Wrong; secondly, we
are inviolably to adhere to the one, and
avoid the other; and, thirdly, the Right we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
do must be done from Principle; which can
no otherwise appear in us than by honouring
and serving the Author of our Being, and
of all the Blessings we enjoy: these naturally
lead us to believe in him, to hope in him,
and to love him; and these are Acts which
constitute Religion. But here, with all due
Reverence, I drop my Pen; leaving the
Consideration of our Duties in a religious
Light to those whose Province it is to
point out, explain and enforce them: to
those, in a word, to whom the Office is
given from above.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_9" id="Footnote_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> Since the first Appearance of this Work in
the Year 1753, the Society for the Encouragement
of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce has
been form’d and establish’d;* in Honour to which,
the Author begs leave to observe that his Complaint
on this Head (which he flatters himself was
a just one) is in some measure obviated: for, from
the particular regard paid by that Society to every
Branch of the Polite Arts, Boys even in the most
inferior Stations of Life (as well as others) have
it’s Countenance and Approbation; and, by liberal
Premiums, receive from it the Reward of their
Genius and Industry. Hence Drawing is already
become a far more general Study in England than
heretofore; and hence, too, it may be hoped
(provided the Plan here laid down be deemed rational)
that Boys of this Class in particular will
daily improve, and make, it both their Study and
Delight to acquire that Perfection which will
manifestly tend to their own Advancement in
Life, and reflect Honour on their Country.
A contemplative Mind, united to a Heart
warm’d with the Love of Mankind, cannot but
see with singular Pleasure the rapid Progress and
growing Power of that highly useful Society:
For, from a beginning of about six private Gentlemen,
a few Years have increas’d their Number
to near three thousand Members; among which
far the greater Part are Persons of Rank, Learning
and Fortune. But to what End do they associate,
to what End do they bestow their
Time, their Thoughts and their Money?† The
Answer is obvious; it is to benefit others, not
themselves: it is to encourage the Industrious,
and reward the Ingenious: and what is still more
exalted, it is to add Power, Strength and Lustre
to their native Country.</p>

<p>* The Society commenced in March 1754.</p>

<p>† Every Member pays at the least two Guineas a
Year; or one Payment of twenty Guineas for Life.
Besides the Committees (which meet almost daily, and
which are open to every Member) the Society, for
the most Part of the Year, assemble once a Week;
at which Times so many useful and curious Matters
are discuss’d as render them a most rational Entertainment.
And, that no Partiality may be shewn, or
Benefit lost, every Member has full Liberty to throw
out his Thoughts, and to propose whatever, in his
Opinion, may be of Utility, and advance the Intentions
of the Society.</p>

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
